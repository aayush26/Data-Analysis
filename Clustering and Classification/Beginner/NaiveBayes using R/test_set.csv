 I am looking for a way to control led on a circuit board using audio input for learning purpose. I have written my own speech recognition system using dynamic time warping in Python but I would like to know if and maybe what models if not all can do Arduino can possibly handle the processing of a 70 by 70 On^2 matrix traversal with fft or dct operations on audio input divided into 10ms frames. Any advice will be appreciated. Thanks 
 I have written a code that transmits data over the I2C channel The device ID and every other stuff is working fine. The only issue being that my code gets stuck at Wire.endTrasnmission. I found the issue using Serial debug messages. Strange thing: When i disconnect the SCL line A5 on arduino Pro Mini the hang disappears and the code starts to function again. A search brought me to this forum http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=66353.0 where a guy talks about the code snippet ifhangunfreeze; is this possible if yes where do i place it? Observation: The hang goes away if i disconnect the SCL line on either of the arduinos communicating the sam edoes not happen if i disconnect the SDA. 
 Is it possible to use the galileos ethernet port through arduino IDE? Or should I buy an arduino ethernet shield? Will I be able to use galileo as a server to which arduino board can send data to? 
 Building a data logging and transmission system here. Ive a RedBeadlab Ardunio Blend with built-in BLE capabilities and a cheap SD / Data logging shield that looks very suspiciously like its copied from the Adafruit one. Using a Stock Arduino Uno board the Data logging shield works out of the box - both RTC TimeSet and cardinfo come back successfully. Stacking the shield on the Blend both examples lead nowhere. The TimeSet states that no connection could be made and the cardinfo says it cant find the card. I assume its a pin conflict of some sort but Im really unsure what I should do to debug/fix it. [edit] As I found out below the SD Module works now - but I still face the problem of not getting the RTC to work. Neither on the shield nor a Tiny RTC module. Again both work fine on the Arduino Uno. [edit2] I had basically the same problem for the RTC module as well - see the answer below. 
 I am reading Accelerometer signals connected to Arduino board through a serial interface. I am using the RxTx library and following is the code. private void initializeSerial { CommPortIdentifier portId = null; Enumeration portEnum = CommPortIdentifier.getPortIdentifiers; while portEnum.hasMoreElements { CommPortIdentifier currentPortIdentifier = CommPortIdentifier portEnum.nextElement; for String portName : PORT_NAMES { if currentPortIdentifier.getName.equalsportName { portId = currentPortIdentifier; break; } } } if portId == null { System.out.printlnPort not found; return; } try { serialPort = SerialPort portId.openthis.getClass.getName 2000; serialPort .setSerialPortParams115200 SerialPort.DATABITS_8 SerialPort.STOPBITS_1 SerialPort.PARITY_NONE; input = new BufferedReadernew InputStre
 I\m working on a line-following robot with my son. We\ve found a sensor array on Robot Shop that will help us but .. there\s two and I\m not sure which will be the best for us. The difference between them as described in this PDF is The QTR-8A uses a voltage divider for each sensors output while the QTR-8RC uses an RC circuit. What I want to do is detect which sensor the followed line is triggering. All I need is a yes/no. But I\m too new to this to decide which of these two sensors would be best for me. 
 In my design one arduino pulls a line high on other arduino the other arduino polls this pin and if that is high sends the data on I2C bus. The first arduino holds the line high for 100ms using the delay method the other arduino is sending the data during this time but the I2C receive interrupt is not being triggered. I have attached a sequence diagram for a better explanation for what is happening. I suspect that the delay method somehow is disabling the I2C ISR from triggering. 
 I\ve seen this video so I think I can connect it through my wifi router to any device. How can I scan for and discover wifi hotspots and then connect to it? Or is there a way to create wifi hotspot of it\s own? 
 I have an ATMEGA 2560 with ~ 8000 bytes of SRAM. I\ve done a lot of memory optimization but i still have one class which is quite large~200bytes. It\s changed one time on runtime and then only read from. So sadly it\s not possible to store it on flash memory. I have an array of this class with 30 elements which is obviously way too big for the arduino~6000 bytes. Is there an efficient way to access the such an array on a SD Card retrieving only one element into the SRAM when needing it. I\ve looked at http://blog.brauingenieur.de/2014/01/20/extended-database-library-using-an-sd-card/ but I\m not sure this will be the most efficient way but it could work. Thanks in advance.

 I hope to find some answers or pointers to a boggling task of mine: Having an Arduino DUE that I want to push to its serial limits I came up with the idea of hooking it up to my rPi via serial at least at 921600 baud. Technically both seem capable of that. A loopback test with the rPi was successful up to 921600 and I\ve managed to get a good quality transmission up to 576000 bps already error-rate should be around 13% but anything higher gets problematic. Problems: DebugConsole CuteCom and minicom don\t have support for any speeds in-between so either 921600 works or it doesn\t minicom supports 1.000.000 baud but this would still mean a ~5% error-rate which is according to my calculations and tests but they are in question here as well ... From the Atmel Doc I\ve got BaudRate = MCK CD 16 From that I\ve derived that with the 84MHz Due a baudrate of 1.050.000 would be the act
 Is it possible to use this with Arduino to record and store videos on memory card? Additionally if someone has already done it a tutorial link would be appreciated. 
 I\m working on arduino based RGB LED strip controller. This simple schematic was used to control 12V channels via 5V PWM signal from arduino: I have also connected an HC-05 bluetooth module to be able to control it using android phone. Android application created for this project is sending 4 bytes to set mode red green and blue colors. It looks like {025500} to set static red color {1000} to start fade mode and {2000} to start blink mode. Here is my first demo video of this project: click here . The problem is that my code works perfectly on Arduino Mega 1280 but when I use Arduino Nano it works only with manual mode and blink mode. If I send {1000} to turn on fade mode LED strip starts to increase random co
 I am currently in an introductory assembly language class.My assignment is to use a sparkfun joystick shield kit to do something with an arduino uno. I figure turning on LEDs is the easiest. We must program it in AVR assemblynote: we have only used nasm assembly all semester. I don\t really know how this needs to be done but I would like the lights to turn on when a button is pressed one LED per button. I also want to use the analog pins to have the joystick LEDs fade in and out. below is the code I have right now and don\t have the equipment to test it. Am I on the right track or is it a horrible mess?The professor was referring to the arduino pins with hex but I couldn\t find a mapping of the pins and their hex values.

 Reading a 1.024m baudrate 77 bit stream from a serial encoder- begin.serial11024000; is accepted- but no idea if UART can actually run there. in screengrab channel 7 is a 8 microsecond clock pulse generated by arduino channel 6 is the encoder response- always begins 13 microseconds after rising edge of clock pulse first part is always 10101101 after that its pretty random as encoder rotates. tried unsucessfully to read the pins at that speed no way then tried reading the repeating data at synchronous microseconds +1 to try reading one bit at a time thru sequential 77 bit words while not rotating- but clocking varies in Arduino program by up to 8 microseconds over the 2 millisecond repeating patterns though. tried the serial read thru serial1 port getting some data but random... with no terminator to rely on wondering if anyone has a suggestion as to how to clear/load serial bu
 I\ve been playing with a GY521 breakout recently with the MPU6050 chip on it though i\ve hit a bit of a problem that I can\t quite work out I know when I rotated the board I rotated ~90 degrees about the Y axis and using the sensitivity numbers from the datasheet 131 and integrating i\ve managed to get something that looks believable from the gyroscope but am having problems with the accelerometer. From a number of sources this being one of them I\ve managed to get the three equations seen on here however when I apply them to either the raw or scaled data as they\re scalers is shouldn\t make a difference? I get a set of data that varies from 0 to 90 but only on the X and Z axes while nothing happens to the Y.

 My current project involves wireless communication between two Xbees. Because I have an Arduino Uno R3 I though I would use it to set up serial communications as opposed to buying a separate adapter. To do this I connected the Tx Arduino pin to the Dout Xbee pin and the Rx Arduino pin to the Din Xbee pin. I then connected the 5v from my Arduino to the 5v on my regulated Xbee explorer and the grounds together. I then connected the Arduino to the computer and opened up the X-CTU software. Also I connected the Reset with GND on my Arduino to avoid removing the chip. When I go to locate the Xbee all that appears is the Arduino Uno on COM port 3 and it fails to establish a link with the Xbee even after navigating through the setup process. Also I tried to reset the XBee as suggested in many tutorials but still doesnt work. I bought an adapter and it works very well. But since there are so many tutorials on how to connect an XBee on an Xbee regulated with the ar
 EDIT: The problem was the cable I was using see answer below. I have a MacBook Pro running OS X Yosemite 10.10.1. I connected my Arduino Leonardo to my computer for the first time today using a Micro USB to USB cable but my computer isn\t detecting it. When I opened the Arduino IDE I selected Tools > Board > Arduino Leonardo but when I try to choose a Serial Port the only options are: /dev/tty.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port /dev/cu.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port /dev/tty.Bluetooth-Modem /dev/cu.Bluetooth-Modem I have tried closing and relaunching the Arduino IDE disconnecting and reconnecting my Arduino Leonardo and restarting my computer but I still only see the four Bluetooth ports. System Information aka System Profiler doesn\t show anything connected to any of my USB ports. T
 I\m working on an embedded project where I use arduinos as a sensor shield for RaspberryPi I have model B. The problem is that the RaspberryPi\s USB port is not powerfull enough to drive WiFi adapter and arduino with sensors. The solution is easy I will power the sensors externally not through the RPi. But I was wondering is it possible to power whole Arduino externally through Vin and use the USB only for serial communication. To clarify I know how to solve my problem - use some other mean of communication than USB - GPIO serial I2C wireless etc... I\m just interested if the whole thing will work with USB cable which has 5V lead cut for example. The main issue I can see with this is that the USB&lt;->Serial chip is powered through USB only then it will now work. 
 Id like to make my 5v pro mini use 3.3 v instead of 5 because i want to use it in an existing piece of electronics that uses 3v throughout. Looking at the specs for the pro mini it says the 3.3v version can accept higher voltages. So is there a regulator i can bypass/bridge that will convert my 5v version to a 3.3v version? or am i wasting my time?

I\m driving the the motor shield with 12v 3A power supply. I read somewhere that the Adafruit steppers should be at-least 5V. Is that correct? Do I need to buy new steppers or any suggestions of stepper driver shield? How many amps do I need to run both steppers at the same time? 1.68 x 2 = 3.36A?

 I\m attempting to send a single char command from my Android app to an Arduino Uno R3 and then receive data from a sensor based on which command is read. I\ve successfully linked my Nexus 7 and the Arduino the RX blinks when I send the command from the app. However I have my Arduino code set up to blink the on-board LED 3 times when a valid command is received - this does not occur. The setup works fine when I use a terminal emulator app or Tera Term on my PC so I\m fairly certain the problem lies within my Java code. The baud rate data/stop bits and parity are all set correctly within the app 115200 8 1 and none so I don\t see it being an issue with that.

 I am using an Arduino UNO and an RXb6 I would link to the data sheet if I could find one to try to decode a RF Signal that controls a remote outlet. I have the devices connected as you would assume 5V+ to 5v Gnd to Gnd Antenna is not connected as I think it would only exacerbate my problem and data is connected to the A0 pin on my UNO. The problem I am having is with all the noise that I am getting with my signal.I hooked it up to my o-scope to give a better idea of whats happening. When no signal is being transmitted this is the noise I am seeing: Just lots of static. When I press the remote button I can see a clean signal come through note that it is cutoff: I was able to export a CSV of the wave and m
 I am a newbie to Arduino. What I am going to do is to change my roll to roll printer to flatbed printer.Rather using print roller I decided to move the bed from a stepper motor.I know how to run the stepper motor for specific distance using arduino. So I need to cheat printer to think that its roller is working and media is going through it.But actually what I am going to do is to monitor the printer motor running or not from arduino input and if the printer motor is running stepper motor will turn or if motor stops stepper motor must stop. What my problem is how can I read that the dc servo motor status? How would I need to wire arduino input to servo motor to get the status. Please show me some light on this.Sorry if this is a newbie question. Thank you.

I would also like to know if the DH/DL values for the coordinator and the router has to be set to each other as the code includes the destination of the frame already as I would like the coordinator to talk to other routers in the network as well.

 I\m very new to Arduino and came to a point where I\m interested in playing with shields such as LCDs. For example I really like the looks of LCD 1602 with keypad module but it seems to be using a lot of pins. By looking at a module / shield how can I tell or at least estimate which pins will be used and which ones I will have left if I stack them with my Uno or Mega without printed schematics?

 Im a beginner to microcontrollers and electronics albeit not really to computers and programming. Starting out with the Arduino I came to a point whereby Im really interested in getting my prototype to talk to a mobile device or a computer to send and receive data for example send sensor data or receive commands. Looking out Ive found out that there are different bluetooth modules with varying pricing points. Further research into differences did not reveal much to me as being a beginner I am struggling to understand what to look out for or how to choose. My question here is: What are the fundemental differences of different Bluetooth modules for beginners such as: HC-05 HC-06 HC-07 And what should one look for when buying a simple Bluetooth module for Arduino? 
 I\m using an Arduino Due board with an optocoupler 4N25 to simulate a button pressed.I have to open and close a circuit that drive an actuator. In that circuit when connected with the tester I\m measuring 6V. I connect the anode to the pin 12 and the cathode in series with a 150-ohm resistor to ground and Collector and Emitter from optocopupler to the circuit and a normal Blink example with the pin 12. When optocoupler is fired on and off respectively with a tester I measure 0V and 1.7V in the arduino part and 4V and 6V. This is not enough and the actuator is always run. I\d like to read 0-6V instad of 4V-6V. Does this depends on how much current goes to the anode/cathode of the optocoupler? Do I have to change the resistor in the arduino part? Any kind of advice? What can I do? I don\t want to use relay because I have read that in respect to a relay they are faster smaller longer-lived and quieter. <img src=http://i.stack.imgur.com/tMwJq.png

 I need to use two stepper motors to move microscope positioning knobs in the X/Y direction. The stepper motors I have are unipolar and are 6V rated I think. I know its possible to drive a unipolar stepper motor via a ULN2003 using an Arduino Uno. I know I can wire it using the 2-wire or 4-wire method. But my questions are: Is it possible to drive 2 of them? What are the modifications I will need to make to the circuit? Will this harm my Arduino? Do I need a stepper motor shield?

 This may seem a little stupid i apologize if so as im new to electronics/arduino. I have 4 4-pin ping sensors. Im running out of available pins on my UNO. I had a ponder &amp; wondered if it was possible to link all 4 sensors trig pins to a single digital pin with the echo pins assigned to their own pin. In my head on each sensor call sorry im used to programming terms all 4 sensors would send a pulse then only the sensor or echo pin in question would be read. Is that plausible? each ping sensor is about 20-30 cm separated but facing internally in a spiral downwards.

 This may sound like a very dumb question and I apologise in advance. I\ve gone through reading about PWM and working on some example sketches to control PC fan speeds using PWM and Arduino. In all documents I read it is mentioned that PWM is a signal. My questions: Is PWM really a signal? To me it looks like an electric current turned on and kept on for a certain time then off for a while repeatedly. What makes this a signal? If PWM is a signal why do we need to connect the Ground from Arduino to the ground of the device to which PWM signal is being sent to? This is confusing me because in my mind for example radio signals do not need a ground connection. The signal comes and gets read. 
 I have am using an Arduino Uno R2 and TLC5940 to control a bunch of RGB LEDs. I want to add an Ethernet Shield R3 so that I can control the LEDs over a web-interface. However the ethernet shield and TLC5940 use many of the same pins. Can I use them together? How? 
 I\ve been reading a bit about moving from Arduino to PCB and it seems a bit daunting. For now all I really want to do is take something I\ve built and make a few changes so that I can actually create a casing for it and make sure everything stays connected. I\ve attached a photo of my project. What I am trying to do is create a box where 4 pushbuttons sit in a box with LEDs next to them. I will probably create foamboard cutouts for the spaces where the pushbuttons and leds sit. The wiring for the push buttons and the LEDs need to be hidden below the foam board along with the arduino itself and the servo motor - which is where I get stuck. What do I need to do to essentially lengthen the wires for the pushbuttons and LEDs and make sure all the components stay secure in the breadboard the push buttons in particular like to pop out? Is there a way to do this without making a PCB? I understand the concept of soldering components into protoboard but as far as cutt

 Sorry I\m new to electronics while I\ve some experience in coding. This let me very curious about the Arduino Due board: it is super powerful and I can run some C++ code that I can not with the normal Arduino Uno. But I lack in electronic theory sorry if the question is a little bit dumb. Can I drive this shield with an Arduino Due? The Due board is at 3.3V while the relays in the shield are at 5V. What do I need to make them run smoothly? Actually I\d like to run 5 of those shield with only one Arduino Due board. Do I have some problem with power supply?

 I\m trying to get a XBEE shield to operate on an Arduino Leonardo. Usually i use the AltSerialLibrary to emulate an extra serial for the xbee. However since the Leonardo comes with two sets of serial i figured I use that instead. //#include &lt;AltSoftSerial.h&gt;//AltSoftSerial XBee513; // RX TXvoid setup { Serial1.begin9600; Serial.begin9600;}void loop { Serial.printlnOdds; Serial1.printlnEnds; delay1000;} The code above aims to write values to both the serial monitor serial and xbee serial1. However in the Xbee\s XCTU program the remote xbee does not recieve any data. Any feedback on how I might fix this will be appreciated. 
 I want to open the window to let the cat enter or go out but the mecanism of the window may me think that the best way should be to use a jack/cylinder I dont know what term is more appropriate in english for that to open and close the door. I will use rfid or another wireless think to know it the cat is in the place and then open the wondow but I want to close the window and let the wndow close event if there is little bit of wind so I need domething robust. Do you know a good hardware with this would be the best piece of code that can help me for that? Thanks in advance 
 I would like to use my Attiny85 as an remote controlled relay switch.I have already tested the sketch on my Atmega328 and it worked.Now I wanted to burn the sketch on my Attiny85 using ArduinoISP but I get the following error in the ArduinoIDE: sketch_dec25a.ino: In function void setup:sketch_dec25a:13: error: class RCSwitch has no member named enableReceivesketch_dec25a.ino: In function void loop:sketch_dec25a:20: error: class RCSwitch has no member named availablesketch_dec25a:21: error: class RCSwitch has no member named getReceivedValuesketch_dec25a:22: error: class RCSwitch has no member named getReceivedValuesketch_dec25a:25: error: class RCSwitch has no member named resetAvailable Thats my code: #include &lt;SoftwareSerial.h&gt;#include &lt;RCSwitch.h&gt;int RELAY_PIN = 2;RCSwitch mySwitch = RCSwitch;SoftwareSerial mySerial1 3; // RX TXvoid setup { pinModeRELAY_PIN OUTPUT; mySwitch.enableReceive0; // Receiver on
 I\ve got this quite basic code running on an Arduino Mega 2560 and the output is looking like I have the serial settings wrong though I can\t work out what to change. void setup { Serial.begin9600; Serial.printlntest123;}void loop{ Serial.printlntest + millis;} The output looks like this: Z7^|Vuo~z{xoIfwi`pQZtest123D4j~Mz~}i}; I\m using the inbuilt Serial Monitor in the Arduino suite with settings 9600 baud and no line endings. I see that the first println in setup is sending the data as expected but all other comms are coming through as nonsense. Any suggestions of what to do? 
 I am using a SEEED SD Card Shield. Everytime I attempt to write the card I get When Using File> Examples> SD > CardInfo: initialization failed. Things to check:* is a card is inserted?* Is your wiring correct?* did you change the chipSelect pin to match your shield or module? Or when using File>Examples> SD> Files: Initializing SD card...initialization failed! I even tried SdFat IDE couldn\t find anything the SD Library by Adafruit No change and other things. I\m using a Funduino MEGA 2560. Could that be the problem?! 
 I have this cheap RF link that I had working with the Arduni UNO but I wanted to make it smaller and ATTiny85 should do the trick. The RF module is connected data pin to PB3 on the ATTiny. But I am having some problems. It does not work and I don\t know why. My code: #include &lt;SoftwareSerial.h&gt;// PINS#define SERIAL_TX PB3SoftwareSerial mySerial-1 SERIAL_TX;void setup { pinModeSERIAL_TX OUTPUT; mySerial.begin 1200 ;}void loop { mySerial.write0xAA; mySerial.write0xAA; mySerial.write0xAA; delay1000;} 
 I am thinking about buying a gps module for Arduino UNO. I would like to install it on a self-build RC-car which is also controlled by Arduino.The problem is I cannot install the gps module on the top of the car on the surface only the bottom and or/middle space is free. My questions are: 1Is there a module which can overcome a small layer of steel max 2cm thick and some plastic and still get a good signal? 2It would be nice to be able to store the data into a memory card. 3It would be a great plus to be able to gather data real-time through some kind of connection. Sadly I do not know how to do here. Is there some place where I can look up any of this? Do you think that this http://www.adafruit.com/products/1272 is what I need? thank you 
 Im designing a shield for Arduino which drives two stepper motors. They are small and require 5V but their max combined current is around 1A way too much for the USB supply. Therefore I will have external 5V power supply connected to my shield. The entire device will usually operate being connected to a PC through USB but still Id like to have a possibility to run it separately. The question is: how to power Arduino itself? From my external PSU through the pins: Sounds as the simplest solution but Im bit worried about the onboard regulator of Arduino while reverse powered. Separate power circuits for electronics and motor: My L293D chips allow for separate power and even different voltage for the motors. It could even be an advantage for my shield as I could use other motors and different power for them in the future. I will however lose the possibility of running the device without USB connection. Same as above with additional barrel j
 I want to use SoftwareSerial with my ATTiny85 and when I google it several projects claim that they are using it... I downloaded the hardware from https://code.google.com/p/arduino-tiny/ but when I try to add SoftwareSerial and compile I get: fatal error: SoftwareSerial.h: No such file or directory Switching the board to UNO makes the problem go away so did they leave it out? How can I fix this? 
 Im starting to get into Arduino a little. Ive got a Small project to start me offTo keep it simple its: 5 level Switches 1 flow switch and 3 solenoid valves. This question is for the Level Switches. Now Im wanting to save Pins as I\m using a Arduino UNO. So would I be right to use the method ive seen around here a few times of Making a Resistance ladder. Question is. 1- Will the method of using the same value of resistors 2k2 work? I dont think so.. As multiple buttons ie the flot switches will be pressed at once it will end up having no idea whats happening correct? I need to be able to Identify each one 0%25% etc etc If I was to use different vales of resistance would that make a difference ? Cheers 
 I have built two parallel H-bridges from Design 1 on this page as you can see in the attached schematic. However when I apply the external power VCC1 in the center of the diagram the two motors do not spin. Using my multimeter I can see that the entire circuit is working: the motor is getting a \forward\ and \backward\ current as the Arduino sets the pins high. The multimeter is reading +/- 5.54V with the motor replaced by the multimeter. Across the motor this drops to 0.13V So then I measure the current by putting my multimeter both in series with the motors and replacing the motors. There\s only 40mA available! Looking around the web I found the suggestion to reduce the 220 resistors at R2 R3 R5 and R6. So I switched in randomly 27 resistors and the output current is still only 40mA. What else should I try to bring up the current enough to drive the m
 I\m trying to read the temperature of a DS18B20 with my ATTiny85 - but I\m getting rubbish data :D I should have gotten ~22 degrees but I\m getting 129! I followed this tutorial i found here but maybe there is something funky with the ATTiny85? 
 I have this Arduino motor shield which is hooked up with two DC motors. The board is the same as this one from Sparkfun. A PWM output controls the speed of the motor and a digital out controls the direction. The problem is that it only works in one direction namely if the direction pin is high. With the direction pin HIGH and 255 is written to the PWM pin Vout on the terminals is similar to Vin. If I reverse the direction by setting the direction pin LOW I would expect Vout to be -Vin ie. the polarity reversed. But not so. I get a little more than zero volt across the terminals. It\s the same for both channels. Edit: The setup is powered from a 9V power adaptor through the barrel jack on Arduino. <img src=http://i.stack.imgur.com/EznN2.jpg alt=Photo of the DC motor connec
 Im planning on building an LED clock but I want it to be lit only when I press the POWER button on my remote control. Using an IR receiver which Arduino sleep mode should I use to reduce the current consumption but still be able to receive this interrupt? 
 In a project Im using an EIA485 bus to send encrypted data packets. That works with Arduinos buffered serial but it is kind of awkward and Im using none of the more complex stuff in that class anyway. If I do not use Serial anywhere in my Arduino sketch is it safe to create my own interrupt handlers for USART_RXC etc. and to directly manipulate the USART registers? 
 I\m using an MPU-6050 chip in order to calculate orientation. It is connected to an Arduino Pro Mini. I am using code written by Jeff Rowberg that uses the internal DMP. The 57600 baud rate crashes the sketch after a minute so I changed it to 9600. Setting TWBR to 14 did nothing. I also modified the MPU6050_6Axis_MotionApps20.h file in order to decrease the FIFO rate. It didn\t really help. Here\s some sample output when the sensor is lying stationary on a desk: 0.80:-4.15:64.500.80:-4.15:64.510.80:-4.15:64.510.80:-4.15:64.510.80:-4.15:64.510.80:-4.15:64.510.80:-4.15:64.510.80:-4.15:64.510.80:-4.15:64.510.80:-4.15:64.500.80:-4.15:64.50FIFO overflow!0.81:-4.15:64.500.81:-4.15:64.50 I suppose that FIFO overflow doesn\t bother me that much but in my opinion it\s inefficient. I\m not sure what I\m doing wrong that causes the FIFO overflow. Any ideas? Edit 1:Code #include Wire.h#include I2Cdev.h#include MPU6050_6Axis_MotionApps20.h

 I have a 1602 LCD screen that works fine on its own. However I wanted to free some pins by using an I2C / IIC LCD controller I purchased separately. While the controller seems to be communicating with my Arduino UNO on the right address I cannot get text to display. By default no code it seems the LCD will have 1 line of 16 solid squares. When using address 27 in my code the LCD will change to 2 lines of 16 squares see photo below. The code also calls for the backlight to flash 3 times which works. However I cannot get anything but 2 lines of squares. Full code is at the bottom of this question. I\m using the LiquidCrystal_I2C library by F Malpartida which seems to be commonly used. Is there a better library I should be using? I\m wondering whether it\s just the wrong pins being used in the code. All sketches I see online use the following pins: <code
 So Ive taken apart an old microwave oven with a touch-sensitive LCD screen. I understand that I could die from playing around with this so Ive disconnected the high-voltage transformer and the magnetron. Im also not going to remove any of the safety switches like the door switch. My question is how is the microwave controlled? Im thinking there is a computer chip somewhere in the circuit and Im looking to replace it with an Arduino board plus some extras like AC relays and such. Im curious as to how the microwave oven controls its functions like power level cooking time and the beeping. Any advise as to how I could get started interfacing? Is the power level controlled by PWM by any chance? Can you PWM alternating current? 
 I was reproducing the Girino the Instructable by Caffeinomane bundled with the Girinoscope the Java GUI by Chatanga. The results worked well and I went on to see if the oscilloscope can go up to higher kS/s. In short originally only upto prescaler 8 works. I removed PWM pin and it works upto 4 but prescaler 2 strangely behaves. Here are the details: I did a preliminary test on prescaler 32 ~38.5kHz. Settings as follows and the same in other tests. The signal the same hereafter is generated by a 555 timer astable multivibrator running at 4.5V 3 AA batteries. The circuitry was simply omitted. I just tied 3.3V of Arduino NANO / ATmega328 to digital pin 6 as the trigger level. There is no +2.5V offset done by the original Girino. The scale should be 0~5V and the sign
 I want to control several undecided cut strips of these led lights: here . I want to be able to turn the LEDs on and off from the arduino but I know that the voltage is too high to work with with the arduino and I don\t want to fry my arduino. I\ve looked into relay modules but I\m a software guy and I don\t understand even the difference between voltage and amperage I think I have the idea down but I get the two mixed up sometimes. I also don\t know how much voltage or amperage I should be giving each strip or how to control that. I have all my code set up to control my arduino with my simple C# form I\ve made but I\m dumbfounded when it comes to hardware can anyone help? Also I\m not well into money so I\d like to avoid spending money on some relays if possible. 
 I don\t understand the books explanation for why a 10k resistor is needed for an open switch to write LOW to a digital pin. I thought no voltage is LOW anyway. Can someone explain in a little more detail why this resistor is needed. 
 I\ve used the arduino uno with the python serial library months ago and some packets got lost in the way. I\ve been searching about serial communication for arduino and I\ve been thinking that I could use some parity systems and other things to guarantee that my packets will arrive. First of all if I use the parity system of the arduino\s serial library how good it will be? I need to send packets like this button was touched but ALL packets must arrive so if some packet fails I need to send it again. How to make it possible? I\m thinking about using the parity system of the arduino\s library but I don\t think if it\s gonna work well. Can somebody point me some good text about it? 
 So I\ve gotten my module working pretty well. It logs data from the DHT22 and sends it to a 192 address on my LAN. However I\d like to log and graph the data. I figured thingspeak is a decent platform for that. However I have no experience doing so and I\m not sure where to start. All the examples use the official arduino shield. I\ve only found ONE example bit of code but it uses the Dallas One Wire temp module. Link I\m in over my head and have no idea how to switch from the One wire to the DHT22. Thanks for the help! I\m using a clone arduino pro mini 5V 16mhz 328. If there\s a better platform than thingspeak I\m open. All I want to do is graph and visualize the DHT22 sensor readings. 
 So this question might sound a bit silly at first glance no I know it sounds flat out insane but not all that silly at second. I have heard once about a guy who transformed some presumably old-ish washing machine into his own personal home-brewing apparatus. It is quite some idea if you think about it. Washing machine can easily solve most issues people have with homebrewing. It can carefully control and adjust temperature throughout the long and complicated process of brewing it can stir it can pump in fresh water. Main question is how to control washing machine to do what I want it to do. Most automatic washing machines already have some controllers but I dont see much chance in trying to simply reprogram them Am I wrong?. Arduino seems like best choice for its simplicity and expandability. However I am still fairly new to Arduino and have trouble imagining how would connecting everything from washing machine motor pump maybe water and temper
 I\m making a project where my plan is to take sensor input from the Arduino and then pass that info by serial/usb connection through either a laptop or a Raspberry Pi and convert it to Json and send it to a webservice in asp.net c# where it gets stored in a database and then the data can be shown on a website so the visitor can see live data from the Arduino sensor on the site and also be able to see what the sensor measured yesterday last month or the average for a extended period of time or a graph. It might be easier to illustrate what I\m talking about: The PC / RPI part is optional it can be using either one. There are a few options as I see it as to which methods could work. But I am unsure about how to implement them and what programs to use for it. First one is to log data to a file on the PC/RPI and then have some shell script either listen for changes
 Im using a sonar sensor to detect proximity and need to control the brightness of an LED strip in direct relationship to the distance detected. For example as someone moves toward the sonar the strip needs to dim. Im using map to do it now crudely but its way too abrupt and Im not sure how best to achieve the effect Im looking for. Ideally as the person moves toward the light it very smoothly fades out in relationship to the persons movement/pace. Initial thoughts / questions: -- Can I use a more refined number type to set the LED brightness other than int?-- Do I need to do something more complex where I detect the delta in the persons movement and use the loop to fade the LED from one value to another? Seems complicated... Any help / ideas on this would be much appreciated! Existing code is below if it helps.Claudia //variables needed to store valueslong pulse inches cm;//LED VARIABLESint frontPin = 6; // front strip connec
 I purchased a ACS711 Hall effect-based linear current sensor http://www.pololu.com/product/2197 and when i read the input it\s basically always the same. After doing some research I think it\s because there is only a 10bit AD converter and since the current is only changing a little bit it\s not enough to catch the change. For my situation I\m pulling around 40-90ma idle and when the motor turns on it jumps up so I want this sensor to see that but it only jumps up to about 120ma. Any tips on how to fix this? Maybe a different sensor? Can I use an amplifier to boost the analog signal? 
 Im working on a project were we are trying to attach accelerometers to soccer players and capture various aspects of movement data. Breadboarded circuits are coming along nicely and Im now looking for how to best protect sensors we can mount on players. All wire at the moment unfortunately - BT next. Although I can find ways to protect the sensor for sensor damaging impact we are essentially interested in player impacts with the ball or ground there are other aspects of protection Im not sure about. Any recommendations on how to protect from moisture without increasing bulk too much minimizing cushioning which could affect the data and of course avoid adding anything that could injure the player? I have come across other examples of movement studies but they have been by musicians or other situations that do not include outdoor weather and sweaty bodies. 
 Im attempting to write data over a serial line to the arduino however I dont want to use the arduino IDE but rather use the command line. In order to do this I have the following commands: $stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 cs8 9600 ignbrk -brkint -imaxbel -opost -onlcr -isig -icanon -iexten -echo -echoe -echok -echoctl -echoke noflsh -ixon -crtscts$echo s123 &gt; /dev/ttyACM0 The code on the receiving end checks whatever or not the input is s123 and if it is starts blinking. I have tested this using the arduino IDE and it worked however this did not work. The sketch looks like this: void loop{ ifSerial.available==4{ byte b1b2b3b4; b1=Serial.read; b2=Serial.read; b3=Serial.read; b4=Serial.read; ifb1==s{ digitalWrite13 HIGH; // turn the LED on HIGH is the voltage level delay1000; // wait for a second digit
 Im working on a kite-related project where Im using Arduino + accelerometer to track data while a kite is in the air. I am struggling a little with the best approach - help on the following questions / issues would be a huge help: -- how best to grab data only while the kite is in the air? just detect with numbers use a switch? other ideas?-- how best to collect the data and transfer to computer for visualization likely with processing but looking at other options. im using this project in workshops with kids in low-income neighborhoods in brazil so will have limited resources. a laptop will be available -but use of mobile also ideal. Thank you!Claudia 
 I wrote a simple program for controlling an LED using mobile. So I bought the HC-05 bluetooth module configured it and then connected it to the arduino. This is the code that I wrote for it. int ledPin1=13;int state;int flag=0;void setup{ pinModeledPin1 OUTPUT; digitalWrite0HIGH; second: Serial.begin9600; }void loop{ ifSerial.available &gt;0 { state = Serial.read; flag=0; } if state == \0\ { digitalWriteledPin1 LOW; ifflag == 0{ Serial.printlnled off; flag=1; } } if state == \1\ { digitalWriteledPin1 HIGH; ifflag == 0{ Serial.printlnled on; flag=1; } }} Everything is working cool with the serial monitor.

 I\m brand new to arduino but I\m trying to figure out how to set up a WASD steering system for my robot I made. I have the physical setup all ready but I don\t know the code to use that would allow me to use my computers keyboard. I would like to still have my keyboard attached to my computer while I do this. I.E. I don\t want to manually plug the keyboard into arduino . I asked this on Robotics stack exchange but they said to ask here. A list of functions/blocks Iof code that is applicable would be the best answer but I\ll take anything that\ll get my bot moving : Edit I\m using a wireless keyboard but my arduino is connected via USB. 
 I have a popular bluetooth module JY-MCU version 1.06 picture below. Before i insert it to my arduino project I want to configure the name bound speed and the pass code using usb-to-serial link. But I am facing a problem where the device does not respond to commands. Please let me explain. I send the module to programming mode by applying +5V on \key\ Then I send commands using CoolTerm program: AT+NAMEmyArduinoProject&gt; OKyour set name Ok. setting the name works as expected. But that is the only thing that worked for me. Other commands give no response: ATAT+BAUD2AT+VERSIONAT+VERSION? Maybe you had this happen to you? I am I sending wrong commands or doing something wrong? Please help me to figure out how to control this module. 
 Okay 2 questions. If I am to replace the Arduino with an atmega328 programmed with a standard blink on pin 13 is this configuration correct do I still need oscillators and whatnot? Second question is what is the max voltage I can power the atmega328 with without frying it? I have seen conflicting answers of this on the net. Some have said 5v while some say 6v can someone clarify? Much appreciated thank you! 
 The following link to the library defines arduino pin 5 for input pin for signal. https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_FreqCount.html But the problem is I\m using an 16x2 LCD display with the arduino pin 5. The display needs pin 5 to work. So the question can solved in two waysto both of which I don\t know the answer. 1Change LCD pin number to other pin. Tried it was a failure. I\ve probably done it wrong 2Change the input pin for the freqcount library. Any idea how to get past this bottleneck? 
 A photoresistor is already a resistor and will limit the voltage in the circuit. Why cant this be connected to a pin and measured? Why is a second resistor needed to connect the photoresistor to ground? 
 For some purpose we need to communicate with Arduino using more that one SIM card but still like to use an only GSM shield. So the idea is to use several SIM holders to commutate each of six SIM wires to the sim we currently use. But it is still the question 1 How we should handle the gsm module itself? Is it okay for it if the SIM wire will be commutated to another SIM when it is in the middle of something? May be we should power off the module before but it unclear how to do it programmatically when it is installed on the top of Arduina Mega 2560 2 should we commutate all six wires or may be there are few signal ones and another shouldnt be never commutated? 3 what is the best way to do this commutation? Relays/transistor switches and so on? 
 I\m very new to arduino related stuff so this question might be really easy to answer.I don\t understand how multiple PWM outputs are supposed to work. Look at the pic. In the first1 case we are using short signal width which would be close to motor staying still. In this case as can be seen short pulses follow each other so does the code. motor1.writeMicrosecondsshortWidth;motor2.writeMicrosecondsshortWidth;motor3.writeMicrosecondsshortWidth;motor4.writeMicrosecondsshortWidth; when motor4 ended it\s output motor1 starts it\s pulse again causing non-problem consequent pulses. In the second2 case pulse is wider which corresponds to setting motor speed close to maximum. After motor1 finishes generating width it\s time for motor2 to generate one. But when it does motor1\s period comes to end and it has to start generate width again but arduino is
 We want to use Arduino Mega 2560 + GSM/GPRS Shield to check some kind of IVR service: Arduino calls to some number. The IVR answers with standard answer which actually a digitaled voice Arduino checks the answer and if it is okay send some DFTM tone and listens for the answer againg. In the majority of applications there is no need to deal with digitalized sound coming from gsm since it is an analog sound and noises make impossible to compare the sound records from time to time. However in that specific application we deal with the IVR voice which is essencially digital and IVR loselessly pass it through the GSM. The standart approach is to obtain the analog sound from sim900 and digitalize it with means of arduino; however Id like to avoid this step and obtain the digital data. I know it is useless for playing the sound but is perferct to compare the obtained data with some sample dataset and detect the situtation when the service is down.

 I\ve been using an Arduino Leonardo on my Windows machine for a few days now without too much trouble but today the COM port disappeared. I\ve been able to successfully send sketches to the arduino and execute them so everything was working until recently. When I look in Device manager on the control panel there is no com port listed for the arduino. If I reset the device then a com port shows up briefly with Arduino Leonardo BootLoader but after a few seconds that disappears. I\ve tried USB2.0 and USB 3.0 ports on my PC and a different cable but to no avail. I don\t have anything listed under Other Devices and I\m out of ideas for what could be the trouble.I\m trying to get it recognised now as just the leonardo with nothing connected to any pin. Any ideas of what to try? 
 I recently got the Arduino Robot and have been looking at the examples for the RobotLibrary. As I looked I found something quite confusing for me at least a few of them describe connecting a sensor like an IR sensor or Ultrasonic sensor to a port with a cable that was provided with the robot. But I never received a cable. Which got me to question what type of cable is this because it is not the same cable you would use on an UNO at least not according to the pictures. So does anyone know what type of cables these are and/or where I can get them? Thanks :smiley-mr-green: Here are the pictures btw: And the next one: 
 I have an Arduino Mega with an MaxBotix MB7066 sonar attached the sonar has the ability to send serial data with it\s reading. It uses a asynchronous RS232 format except the voltages are 0-Vcc.

The baud rate is 9600 8 bits no parity with one stop bit.What I get from the device is as follows: sonarSerial.read while sonarSerial.available 431926617989300 What do I have to get to the information? Or is my sensor just retuning garbage? Please see the code below: #include &lt;SoftwareSerial.h&gt;#define pin1 3#define pin2 5 //pwm#define pin3 6 //analog#define pin4 10 //RX for sonar TX for arduino#define pin5 11 //TX for sonar RX for arduinoSoftwareSerial sonarPortpin5pin4;void setup{ Serial.begin 9600; pinModepin1 OUTPUT; pinModepin4 OUTPUT; pinModepin5 INPUT; sonarPort.begin9600;}void loop{ di

 My project involves Android Samsung Galaxy 2 to Arduino Uno communication via HC-05. HC-05 is connected to Arduino on pins 1011 using SoftwareSerial lib. I got this setup running for a while and was satisfied by the outcome - my bi-directional communication worked fine. Issue: I made a change to the communication protocol and now messages sent from Android to Arduino get corrupted. It happens under particular circumstances - when Arduino writes streams packets of data to Android and at the same time monitors the input from Android for a particular message which signals the end of communication. This message when read from SoftwareSerial buffer gets corrupted. This corruption is not consistent - it corrupts the packet in seemingly random way. Ive already run many tests and am pretty sure that this message is not corrupted on the Android side. Questions: Is there anything about HC-05 or Soft

 Two goals: Make an LED turn on when a person touches two conductive pads e.g. two square of aluminum foil Make the RGB LED change color depending on how hard the pads are squeezed. I will figure out the color algorithm later. For now I just need to be able to sense variable conductivity/capacitance/current one of those?. I have an Arduino LilyPad. I know this can be done because I\ve seen it before just don\t remember the code or circuit. Example image: I know the human body is conductive so I\m not quite sure why the LED won\t go on when I contact the conductive pads. My only hypothesis is that the resistance is too high but that must mean some current is going through no? Thanks. 
 This topic have been covered in various places but I still think it hasn\t been thoroughly explained anywhere. Doing google search on connecting Arduino to Raspberry Pi via i2c gives for example this page . While apparently this should work there is a factual error there: on arduino side pins used for i2c do have internal pull ups and they are activated by Wire library. Digging further I\ve found following information: However it turns out that these are weak high-resistance pull-ups; the Pi has strong pull-ups which dominate those on the Arduino making direct connection safe. What does safe mean? And how weaker are those pullups compared to raspberry pi ones? Let\s check: rpi i2c pullup: 1K8 arduino i2c pullup: 2
 Recently got an arduino kit. Came with a 28BYJ-48 step motor and a Tower Pro SG90 micro servos.

 I am experimenting with this idea: keep a DTCXO in sync with some frequency standard. I have all the parts I can afford but I cannot figure out a way to do it. Parts I have: Arduino Leonardo a u-blox 6010 based GPS module with PPS output and a proto shield with DS3231 DTCXO chip mounted. My big idea is that DS3231 have aging registers that would affect the clock frequency. By keep counting the 8192Hz square wave output of DS3231 and keep it in sync with the 1Hz signal from the GPS module I can keep the DTCXO in sync with a reference clock. This in turn would give me a relatively good 32768Hz clock reference that I can build a frequency counter on. Both 8192Hz and PPS are interrupt driven. Anyone have an idea on how to do it? Does this spell Artificial Intelligence on AVR as my instructor suggests? 
 i just set up 2 displays 3 digit 7 segments and the displays seems to be blinkin i know they are suppose to blink but so fast that the human eye cannot detect it . Im using the SevSeg Library and this is how my code looks: void setup { byte numDigits = 3; byte digitPins[] = {2 3 4}; byte segmentPins[] = {5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12}; sevseg1.beginCOMMON_ANODE numDigits digitPins segmentPins; byte digitPins2[] = {14 15 16}; byte segmentPins2[] = {17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24}; sevseg2.beginCOMMON_ANODE numDigits digitPins2 segmentPins2;}void loop { whiletrue{ sevseg1.setNumbernumber0; sevseg2.setNumbernumber1; sevseg1.refreshDisplay; sevseg2.refreshDisplay; }} I need to add 2 more 3 digits 7 segment displays so i was wondering what is it that is causing the blinking. Im using Arduino Mega. 
 I have an Arduino attached to an accelerometer sensor. Im looking to detect the motion of a head shake sideways. While I am able to stream the readings from the sensor I am unsure how to buffer values in Arduino until a condition is met. Example using Y axis : Y=0.00 Nothing happensY=1.00 Left turn occurs keep valueY=-1.00 Right turn occurs keep valueY=1.00 Left turn occurs keep valueY=-1.00 Right turn occurs keep value shake head condition fulfilled four left/right value detected jump to function. Any advice on how to go about doing and perhaps a sample example will be greatly appreciated. 
 I\m trying to stack the Adafruit Data Logger Shield https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-data-logger-shield/overview onto a CuteDigi Sim900 GPRS Shield so that I can upload data collected eventually by a GPS breakout to a server at certain intervals. The problem is that I can\t seem to get the two shields to play nicely together. I\m a beginner with the Arduino and electronics in general so hopefully this is just a noob issue. When I power on the GPRS Shield the data logger stops outputting the Date/Time to the serial monitor. And when I turn the GPRS Shield off the serial monitor continues again and shows the Date/Time from the data logger. They don\t share any pins that I\m aware of and I\ve tried connecting a 7.4V li-po for external power with no success. Any help is greatly appreciated! 
 My goal is to build an extremely low cost quadcopter by using the sensors of my smartphone it will be mounted on the quadcopter. The arduino will only control the speed of each motor as received from the smartphone. What methods exist to transfer data from a smartphone to arduino? My first idea was to simply use USB but it turns out that my smartphone doesnt support the USB host mode. Is it possible to send data over USB without USB host mode? What alternatives do I have? I thought of using the audio port: Can I directly connect an audio channel to analog in?

 I am looking to utilize Pin 13 and an external LED to flicker as either the Rx or Tx LEDs do when Serial data is transferred through the Arduino. The existing code is all in real time to function with external buttons so there can\t be any delay.

 I\m looking for a complete pinout of main board with Ethernet R3 .I\ve found one here which low quality and seems not complete where are the digital I/O pins?. BTW it was not a good idea for Arduino to name this board Arduino Ethernet as this is pretty useless for searching online :- Edit : As Omer pointed out Ardiuno Ethernet board is mostly compatible with Uno board.Led pin is 9 Uno = 13 and pins 10-13 are reserved for Ethernet interface. 
 I\ve been wondering for a long time what these pins labeled ICSP and blank do. I can\t seem to find a diagram that explains them so I\ve been wondering: What are they for? Are they GPIO or do they do something special? How can you use them? Thanks for the help. 
 I have a problem with powering my LCD Keypad Shield from a DC cable 4 AA batteries or 9V battery. Everything looks good but the LCD screen doesnt display anything. When I used a USB cable the screen works as it should. What is the problem? 
 Assuming we wish to control a small toy car with an arduino - meaning spinning the right and left wheels forward and backward and being able to break and control the speed where each wheel has its own engine but of course two engines on the same side will run on the same speed and direction. We saw we have two main options - Buying and wiring up a H-Bridge or buying a motor shield which is based on one. Are there any advantages for using a motor shield? Thanks in advance. 
 I have a mircocontroller that\s looking to be powered by a 5v source. I am trying to \cypher off\ some of this power from a 25 pin serial port which is being powered by a constant power source.

Please note I\m not an electrical person at all and so hope this is actually possible otherwise my 3 months + program\s work doesn\t really add to anything. I\ve tried a 9v battery but it didn\t seem to hold its charge? I\m reading these labels going what the ... so you can probably tell coding the board wasn\t the easiest either.

 Im Tom. Im pretty new to electronics and programming but Ive been getting better. So recently I bought a 93lC46B EEPROM from Element 14 It was $0.28! Why not!. Ive been doing some research and reading the datasheet VERY carefully. But I still cant get the EEPROM to work right. Im using an Arduino Uno to program the chip by using the Bit-Banging method. So what Ive understood is that I need to cycle the clock then pull the CS Chip select to high and then cycle the clock after each bit like this: digitalWriteCLK LOW;digitalWriteDATAIN VALUE;digitalWriteCLK High; But so far that method hasnt been working right. I cant seem to read or write to the device properly. Im using this set of bits to write 1 and 2 to the first address of the ROM: 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0. Heres my code so far Sorry in advance on how bad it is: #define DATAOUT 11//Comes from DO on chip MISO#define DATAIN 13 //G
 Im trying to program my Arduino Due and it seems that I have to disconnect the display from it every time. Is there a work around for this? Im using a 7 TFT with a CTE TFT LCD/SD Shield with a arduino due board. 
 I am trying to modify the example given in the this page to a basic throughput and BER test with two nRF24L01+ and Teensy 3.0 modules. I want to modify the nrf24l01_send_string example in a way that I can remove the powerUp powerDown and delay and transmit the next packet purely based on the ACK received from the receiver. The problem is RF24 class does not seem to have a method to transmit ACK not ACK+Payload and the datasheet does give any information on the structure of the ACK message. The example works when powerUp and powerDown are removed but I need to modify it to measure throughput by removing the delay. 
 I am making a basic project that will have 4 or 5 arduino nodes. Each arduino will have a bluetooth module attached. The thing I want is I want to be able for each one of these arduinos to know the other is present in the room let\s say 5 meters. For my experience in the cellphone I don\t even have to pair bluetooth devices to know about their presence as long as they are in visible mode. Since I just need to know their presence and no exchange of information will ever happen I probably will never have to pair them right? For this project I need a bluetooth BT module that: 1 Enables me to change the ID of each arduino so that even if I use my cellphone to scan for BT devices I will see Arduino1 Arduino2 etc... instead of default-factory-names. 2 Enables me to scan around for existing devices every time each X seconds because I want each arduino to know if the others are in the room. Will this module do the trick? <a href=http://www.ebay.co
 I have googled all around and I know about some tricks to make ATmega328 not being a power hog. I am using Arduino Nano V3.0 . However I didnt find out what is the minimal consumption possible with it? My project consists of an Arduino that will wake up each 10 seconds and by bluetooth BT will scan for existing devices and if one specific device is not listed it will lit a LED for 5 seconds and then go to sleep again. In sum: 1 Sleep for 10 secs 2 Wake up 3 Scan for BT devices 4 If device ABC is in the list go to 1 5 Lit LED 6 Delay 5 secs 7 Go to 1 For bluetooth I will use NRF8001 because it is the most efficient BT module I know so far. Can you give me some ideas of what tricks should I use to make this ATmega328 and BT module last like one year with a 500mAh battery ? Has anyone tried this

 I am interested in using an Arduino Uno to produce an analog signal by running PWM through an RC low-pass filter. I\ll be controlling a highly dynamic object and need a clean voltage signal to avoid instabilities. Per this calculator on RC designs it\s suggested that one strategy to reducing voltage ripple is to increase the PWM frequency. With PWM configured to a default of 980Hz for pins 5 and 6 and PWM of 490Hz for the remaining pins I\ve decided that this will create too much voltage ripple for my filter. I\ve found resources that describe how to configure the registers to increase the PWM frequency rather drastically. My question is very simple: Are there any disadvantages to using a higher

 I am not experienced about I2C communications but I do happen to have two HMC5883L magnetometer modules that I wish to connect to a single arduino. It uses I2C protocol and hence the slave device will have a fixed address. Now Can I change the address of one of my sensors so that the Arduino can differentiate between the two? I seem to find no way out by reading the datasheetThanks in AdvanceSiddharth Jha P.S. Can an MPU 6050 module be used to find angle of rotation in X-Y plane Parallel to the ground? 
 Im looking to build my a wirelessly controlled lamp and have a few questions. Would I be able to use the Adafruit HUZZAH CC3000 breakout board to receive commands from a website and control a connected lamp? I just set up a NodeJS server with webpage on my PC and using socket.io and Firmata I was able to communicate with the Arduino using the webpage over a serial connection. Could I set up similar implementation except instead of communicating over serial Id communicate using Wifi? Would I need to host a web server on the Wifi board itself to communicate with the Arduino or is there some way to just use the wifi board as a communication between external site and Firmata? 
 If Arduino is OSH that simply uses 8-bit Atmel AVR MCU as a design component then can Arduino somehow be tweaked to work with a 64-bit CPU/MCU? If so what might this entail? 
 Please help me. There is a conflict when I put GSM and Bluetooth module in one MCU. The problem is when I use the GSM the Bluetooth will not respond and vice-versa. 
 Im currently using an Arduino Uno R3 but want to switch to Leonardo for the USB-ability. The Uno can work from the USBs 5V. Looking at the Leonardos schematic it seems the only input to the voltage regulator is from the power connector. This makes sense as its a 5V regulator which needs > 5V in. But I dont see the MOSFET which connects the USBs 5V to the boards 5V like theres one on the UNO. So does the Leonardo need the separate power input connected? 
 I want to collect data both Humidity &amp; Temperature from 80 sensors. let\s say I have 80 DHT 11 Humidity &amp; Temperature sensors for ex. in a warehouse and one Arduino Uno R3 pack. It\s clear that arduino has no so many pins to connect. I\m sorry that I don\t know if it\s possible. If so what can I use to achieve this?Thank you all for your suggestions. 
 i am building an outdoor sensor with a combination of a custom Arduino board and a battery +solar charging. I experience strange behavior when the temperature falls below a certain value i can reproduce it by putting it in the freezer regardless which type of battery i am using. The custom Arduino runs without power-regulation straight from the 3.7volts the battery can provide. How can i prevent this to happen? I guess a little heating would be not really a solution as i am trying to consume as less energy as possible.Would a step up regulator possibly help? Any other ideas? ---Update---Thanks to your comments here i figured out that the AVR 328p should not be operated below a voltage of 3.7v if run at 16Mhz. As i am running with a 3.7v LiPo Battery that could easily explain my problem i guess. My first try to decrease the processor speed to 8Mhz with a Prescaler worked but the GSM Fona does not seem to like it. So i would like to try something in between like 10Mhz

 Im planning a project that involves sending data from a door phone to an android phone and vice versa using the RN-52 chip from sparkfun. Because of the nature of the project it is necessary to be able to send and receive audio simultaneously is this possible? I\ve done some googling and it seems to me impossible because of sink/source since you cant have both at the same time using A2DP. Can this be done with another profile I don\t know of? Even if that were to work can the chip handle two way communication? Is this project feasible with BT or should I be looking at WIFI-communication instead? Ultimately it would be nice to be able to use BT because of costs. Edit: Can I use bluetooth hands free profile? This profile is AFAIK intended to send audio to and from a phone amongst other functionality. The chip does support HFP/HSP can this work? 
 I\m currently trying to implement an edited version of the CharlieBearV2.pde sketch from the Charlie\s RFID Bear project on Makezine. Beforehand I tested the RFID reader I\m using an ID12 from Sparkfun to make sure all my RFID tags register which they do and I used the default Adafruit Wave Shield library to test the playing of sound on the Arduino which it does. Unfortunately my edited version of the CharlieBearV2.pde program does not read the RFID tags play music or even outputs the programmed error messages in the serial monitor. Instead it\s printing out a string of x and o characters that I cannot copy correctly. When I try to paste it it only appears as xxx. The error only appears when I plug in my Wave Shield. Here\s the output on my serial monitor: <img src=http://i.stack.imgur.com

 I recently purchased a W5100 based ethernet shield for my arduino Uno and looks like this . I had been following the guide here and connected the pins accordingly - 5V to 5V GND to GND MOSI to 11 MOSO to 12 SCK to 13 and SS to ten. I booted up a default sketch webServer under Ethernet and plugged in and ethernet cable. - PWR LINK SPDand FDX all lit up with Rx blinking for first 10 or so seconds. I then go to the IP specified on the arduino sketch and nada. Also my router doesn\t show the shield under the attached devices. Therefore I figure it\s a problem with my connections. Can anyone help me? Googling has only brought my lots of info about shields and little info on these modules.

If I reset the board with the push button or by disconnecting the serial monitor and reconnecting it still fails to send the HTTP request. I have checked my ram usage and it doesn\t appear to have any sort of leak in that regards. I have spent days looking online for similar issues and can\t seem to find anything related. To make this all the more confusing the board just seems to freeze it doesn\t give any sort of error on anything. And the freeze seems

 In the process of trying to make a small system that will last a while on 4 AA batteries I\ve reduced my Arduino project to a barebones system that when asleep draws a tiny amount of current from the batteries. However to achieve this I found it would be necessary to cut power to the two attached peripheral devices connected to an ATMega328P-PU. One of them is an I2C device and the other is a serial device and both are attached to the hardware serial/I2C pins as appropriate. In terms of powering the peripherals the bases of two transistors are connected to two of the digital pins and power to them is controlled from code via these transistors. Both devices are 5V and when the system is running the total current draw is around 200mA. Basically this setup works however I\m getting random system hanging and essentially an unreliable project. Sometimes when I power it up it will work as normal but then hang and not sleep. Other times it will sleep but t
 I am working on a project that needs to drive a relay board. I\m looking at the ETHERNET board with PoE and according to the documentation here http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardEthernet the output of the PoE module is 9V. Is that the voltage to expect out of the Vin pin? The Relay board that I want to use http://numato.com/downloads/dl/file/id/29/product/47/user_manual.pdf specifies that it wants a 7-12V power supply. I want to confirm that this is the case so I can use the voltage out of the PoE and I don\t need to add a separate DC power supply to this system. 
 I\m just starting off with using the Arduino and was learning about PWM http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/PWM . Below is what my circuit looks like. Below is the very simple code. const int pinNine = 9; // LED connected to digital pin 9void setup { // initialize serial communications at 9600 bps: Serial.begin9600; // set the digital pins as outputs pinModepinNineOUTPUT;}void loop { analogWritepinNine 0; } I was expecting my LED to not be lighted as its a 0% duty cycle. I even change the pinNine outputValue to 64 127 etc but for some reason the LED is always lighted. Any ideas? 
 I am working on a project that involves sending motion sensing data wirelessly from an arduino to computer. Sensor readings have to be transmitted continuously say every mili second.

I don\t want to waste money. 
 Im looking into using the local time of the PC via Ethernet but without an Internet connection. My project uses only LAN so theres no internet. Not considered Options: The RTC library uses RTC of course and for now Im not considering it to make my project simpler and cost less. via NTP which uses the internet via ethernet Im using ethernet shield but w/o internet local time in PC BUT using USB Im using ethernet instead of USB Is there any available solutions aside from what Ive researched as of now? 
 Yes you read that right. An Apple IIe . I have many retro computers and I was thinking that since the Apple II line of computers especially the IIe have pretty speedy serial ports that it should be somewhat simple to use an Arduino to send data to/from the Apple. My issue is that all of my every-day computers are USB based with no RS232 serial. I guess I could boot up an old Linux laptop that has a serial port but that seems too cumbersome given my limited desk space. :- Anyway Ive Googled but Im not finding anything. Since most Apple IIe disk images are pretty small &lt;144k or so they should fit pretty easily into say an Arduino DUE that I have. Or better yet using the DUE to mount as a USB device that could send over to the IIe would be great. So my question is does anyone know of any site that explains how this could be done? Thanks! EDIT OK turn
 According to my current poor understanding only the PWM pins with the ~ among the digital pins ignoring Analog pins can be passed to analogWrite . I understand the Servo therefore - since interfaced by a variable voltage signal - must be connected to such a PWM pin. Why is the humble Piezo Buzzer not bound to this condition? Why can I connect the buzzer to a digital pin that is not PWM and so should only be able to output binary LOW HIGH voltage at some consistent frequency and still achieve a varying sound by calls to the tone function? Surely under the limitations of being digital and non-PWM the pin could only cause some consistent buzzer frequency? Im reading online that the Piezeo Buzzer does indeed require a PWM digital pin but I can connect it to any digital pin on my Galileo gen2 and have it function seemingly correctly differing tones produced. Also since slightly relevant; what exactly is the difference betw
 With a very simple connection of an LED which can withstand 5V to ground and to a pin on my Galileo gen2 I can never output a non-zero voltage from the pin via analogWrite regardless of whether the pin is digital or analog although PWM digital works The LED is in the correct bias and Im calling pinModepin OUTPUT before attempting to call analogWritepin 255 or any 2nd parameter in-between even though its not even necessary. The LED glows if I call digitalWritepin HIGH on both analog and digital pins but does not glow at all for analogWritepin 255 with the same configuration and pins nor does it for any 2nd param in [0 255]. This holds for whether the call is attempted in loop or setup . The only possible way I can get the LED to receive any power from analogWrite is through a digital PWM pin but I know the other digital pins can still pr
 Im trying to send a large packet to an arduino with an ethernet shield on it? Im using the built in RX buffer of W5100 controller to store the data but I need more memory at least 16K of buffer space the W5100 only has 8K of RX buffer space. I have control over the server side of things as Im writting the server process myself so I can take solutions on that side. Is there some hack I can use in the TCP protocol to have the packet broken up? Edit: Im using the SFML 2.1 network api on the server side.

 I\m trying to get students to experiment with Arduino. However due to a lack of boards two teams of students will collaborate on each board. They will push their own code independent from each other and use half the pins. The hardware part isn\t really a concern: students will push their sketches on a server that uploads them on the board or something like that. What I\m worried about is the software part. How can I allow two sketches to run on the same board and allow the user to upload sketches without resetting the board ? As of my understanding using the flash memory isn\t an option because the board must be reset before it can be written. My first idea was to compile the students\ C code into custom-made assembly and then push the assembly code to the board which stores it into RAM and interprets it. However my biggest problem would be implementing functions I don\t really have a clue of how I could do

 I am wondering if anybody has ideas for developing an Arduino-based system that would use RFID to log occurrences when two people are in close proximity to each other e.g. &lt;= 1 meter. Ideally I would like to construct something that would operate in a manner very similar to the OpenBeacon system -- and preferably the events/data would be transmitted via wi-fi in real time. My ideas are as follows so any feedback or alternative solutions would be greatly appreciated. Please keep in mind that I am not an engineer! I am thinking of using a wi-fi enable microprocessor e.g. Arduino Yun that would serve as the reader or detection system. For beta-testing this device could be set in an enclosed case and attached to a belt. I presume it would require a fairly robust battery supply. The other person would be wearing an RFID tag that has a range of &lt;= 1 meter and would log the event. Ideally a reading would take place roughly every 30 seconds and the cap
 Building a 9x9 LED matrix and facing following 2 problems in Arduino code The current code displays 2 images using byte arrays and then using bitRead one by one each for a certain duration of seconds. Persistence of vision is obtained by a delay of 300ms. There is a subroutine called upon in the main loop function with arguments of desired byte array and duration. I want to control the images by using 2 push buttons push button1 and it displays 1st image until button2 is pressed push button2 and second image is displayed until button1 is pressed. But the scanning algorithm exits the scan routine upon completion of the given input duration and restarts the routine with new argument byte array of image2. I WANT THE IMAGE TO BE RETAINED ON THE MATRIX UNTIL BUTTON IS PRESSED. Cant figure out how to accomplish this. If i nest the routine in a DO WHILE loop then my problem is that how will the buttons be read from the main loop? Because I believe as long as the subr
 I have a prototyping shield for an Arduino Uno. I accidentally plugged the shield into my arduino so that the pins were all off by one. I didn\t think this was possible but it turns out that the extra pin just slips between the gaps in the pin headers: I powered it on not realising. The arduino didn\t show any LEDs so I powered it down saw my mistake and plugged it all in again. Now though A0-A5 are all reading high values ~900-1000 when I do analogReadA0 even when I have pulldown resistors on them and they still read like that when I unplug my shield all together. The digital writes all work perfectly. I\m thinking that I\ve broken the Arduino. Is that possible or could it be something else? 
 I have got a Problem with the MPU6050_DMP6 Code as it sometimes hangs when its running. It seems to stop randomly after some time and it makes no difference if i have the Arduino powered from USB USB and Running Serial Monitor or from 9V Battery. I did minor changes to the code: Added Raw Values and Datalogging on a Micro SD Card with a Catalex Micro SD Adapter for Arduino and removed parts like TeaPot Demo and so one because i dont need them for my application. But i dont think this problem occus due to my changes because i think i saw this freezing also with the Basic MPU6050_DMP6 Code.The sketch referrs to the MPU6050_6Axis_MotionApps20.h library here: https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/blob/master/Arduino/MPU6050/MPU6050_6Axis_MotionApps20.h I tried the Datalogging with SD-Library and SDFatLibrary but the Problem occured with both. 
 I am building a wireless system that has got an Arduino with a XBEE as the end user and I need to acquire data/control that Arduino from a PC graphical interface. As far as Im aware there are two options to obtain the communication: I could use another Arduino with XBEE coordinator that is connected to my PC serial to control the end user. The code is stored in this Arduino which works as a bypass between PC and XBEE. I could simply use a XBEE without Arduino coordinator connected to my PC to control the end user. The code should be stored within the PC or the XBEE to establish communication and control data transmission to different end users ??? As I am new to the Arduino world would you please direct me to the best/easiest solution to obtain such thing? 
 Im trying to do some fairly simple serial communication and have things partially working but am pretty confused about a couple results Im getting. For a little background Im using an Arduino Mega 2560 to try to communicate with a Dynamixel servo MX-64 over TTL half-duplex asynchronous with Tx1 and Rx1. Basically I construct some byte arrays as instructions send them over to the servo with Serial1.write and then read back a reply. Ive actually gotten it to work pretty well if I use Serial1.readBytes specifying the length of the buffer number of bytes Im expecting. Im also reading back what I originally sent first as well as the response second since I have Tx1 and Rx1 tied together required in my setup because this servo only has one data wire. However I dont understand the difference between Serial.readBytes and Serial.read . If I do Serial.read just prior to <cod
 I have Sparkfun Pro Micro Leonardo compatible board. I got it because I plan to build my own array of controls for use in flight/racing sims. My starting point is LeoJoy and I didnt have any trouble getting this up and running. Installed just fine and I have a programmable HID joystick available in windows. It seems to work by modifying the RAWHID code in the default libraries to spoof being a HID joystick. However my board was now stuck in joystick mode with no available COM ports for uploading new sketches. Resetting the board by grounding the RST pin enables the COM port but very very briefly. Not enough time to send new sketches. After about an hour of trying different timing I finally did upload an empty sketch to the board before it went into Joystick mode. So Im good for now but Im a bit worried that Im going to have to repeat this every time I want to make a change to my program. Am I doing something completely noobish here? Is this t

 I have been tasked to find a way of communicating to a webservice from my microcontroller - yay! With little-no real grasp on sms/etc due to not ever \using\ it before it appears that my knowledge of GPRS is well none existent. So I\ve come here in hope that someone could tell me if there is such a way for a microcontroller to \send data out\ though well a \sim card\ via an sms message. This has left me a little lost If i\m honest. My project involves \tracking\ a vehicle still working on finding a GPS module for that and then sending the coordinates back to HQ at hourly intervals via text message. So My obvious question is this: What GPRS sim card module will allow me to do this? I read here although the accepted answer there for a chip requires external power and so is of no \true\ use to me as the whole unit needs to be power

 Ill be teaching a year 10 class on the Intel Galileo gen2 and therell be a wide but high-level programming curriculum which includes introduction to console printing using Serial . Id like the students to be able to write their printing code in setup so that its only printed once and easily readable by them. However its impossible to be fast enough to upload a sketch and open the Serial Monitor which flat out refuses to open before the sketch has started and the Serial Monitor closes itself upon re-uploading code. Without unnecessary and potentially for the students confusing use of the delay function in setup its impossible to read any output originating from setup ; only things printed in loop which are constantly re-printed are ever discoverable. So; is there a way to somehow keep the Serial Monitor open or make it capture output from before its opened or d
 I need to light up 19 RGB LED strips which it seems would require 19*3=57 PWM outs and 57 transistors. The transistors arent an issue but of course the 57 PWMs is. Even if I hacked the digital IO ports to work as PWM I still wouldnt have enough. How can I do this more simply? Is there some kind of device I can get that would let me just pass data to it perhaps over I2C and it would control many PWMs? Is there another solution I havent considered? Maybe whatever is used to control those 8x8 RGB LED dot matrixes? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

 I have a project which involves a photocell an led a push button and a small hobby servo tower pro sg5010 - the project works as expected when the arduino is powered by usb but when I switch to battery power 4 AA batteries - it doesn\t work. When powered by batteries the servo actually starts right up and moves to the correct angle so I feel like it should be getting enough power but when I push the push button it doesn\t move to the new angle. I can hear a clicking noise of the servo on a regular interval like a clock and my LED flickers on and off at about the same interval. If I\m doing something wrong can anyone point it out? If it\s just that the servo is not getting enough power is there a way to add a transistor or something so that I don\t have to add a separate power supply for the servo I\m not

 What I want to do is allow Arduino A to send some constant value to Arduino B . I sense something inherently wrong with my approach but I cant figure out what it is. So in the diagram below you will see Arduino A setting its Analog Pin 0 as OUTPUT and write a value 2 every 500ms. On Arduino B we have Analog Pin 0 set as INPUT to receive and print data to Serial. The GND pins of both Arduinos are also connected. When this setup is executed Arduino B is constantly receiving data in the form of a 3 digit number starting with 3XX. I am starting to believe this is voltage value? What is inherently wrong with this idea?

I have port forwarding set-up on the modem router so that the Arduino web page can be accessed from the outside world and it does work I can see the page from anywhere but its page serve rate is impractically slow. The page takes 30 - 45 seconds to load up. I have the RaspPi with Apache set-up also in the house using the exact same port forwarding settings - with a different port - and it serves pages to the WAN/Internet very fast. Has anyone any ideas what might be wrong ? Thank you 
 I am making a project that requires bluetooth communication between a Raspberry Piequipped with a bluetooth dongle and a standalone atmega168 circuit. I want to be able to transfer information serially between the two devices over bluetooth. I have selected the hc-06 for the arduino and some usb bluetooth dongle for the PI. I would like to know if connecting the hc-06s TX and RX pins to the RX and TX respectively pins of my atmega will work or not. If not I would like to know how to achieve that bluetooth on a standalone arduino-powered microcontroller 
 I\m trying to understand and adapt this tutorial: https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-led-strips/current-draw to my own use. I am doing essentially the same thing except I have this single color LED strip and I don\t fully understand how to power both the arduino and the led strip from the same power source. I tried to wire it using the diagram above and something started smoking I think the IR transmitter. I don\t know much about circuits but I\m pretty sure that\s not good. In this diagram the 9v represents DC power the IR sensor on the left represents the transmitter the IR on the right is the receiver and the white LED is the LED strip with two outputs + - In the fritzing diagram for that tutorial they
 I have an Arduino Megs 2560 board and using Serial 2 for communication with SIM9000A GSM Modem. I send over a HTTP get request by using appropriate AT command strings.

 I am building my first 4wd vehicle with Adafruit motor shield with one Ultrasonic sensor and one small servo to move sensor. I am facing some problems. Bought 4 motors 2 GM9 and 2 GM3 found the difference when start running and GM9 were running double the speed of GM3. Tried to slow down th eGM9 with speed in code but now one of the motor stop many times while other run. Running spearate power for Arduino now USB and 9v batteries for motorshield. Should I remove the jumper on motor shield as found that after removing 9v battery its getting some volts from Arduino and motors running very slowly. Servo motor is not running at all. While its pins are according to the circuit. Should 9v batteries will be OK to run 4 GM9/GM3 motors + 1 small Servo? if not please recommend any other. When running I feel small smell from boards nothing is hot is it a problem? Too many questions but tried to put in one place. Thank
 my Adafruit motorshield is getting current from Arduino board even after disconnected from battery. I was planning to give separate dc power from 6 AA cells to motor shield but not sure if extra current will enter into Arduino and damage it. I have Ultrasonic sensor connected to motorshield which is getting +5v from board may be Arduino. Please suggest how to solve this problem. Thanks

 A brief description of what Im doing here. I wanna make a pet project basically a device be it Arduino or raspberry pi that I can connect to via bluetooth / wifi both preferably that will be connected to a stereo system and allow me to play music. I essentially want to make a wireless sound system in my house. My question is is raspberry pi more adequate for my needs? Or would arduino get the job done? I know that raspberry pis are essentially mini computers so I feel that the raspberry pi would be too much since all I really need to do is design a bluetooth / wifi interface and send the signal to the aux cable connected to the stereo. Any help would be really useful here. Ive never worked with either/or and this is my first project with Arduino / Raspberry pi hello world. Thanks in advance. EDIT: In response to comments below a greater idea of what I want to do: I want to design an item that will appear on local wifi as a sound device. i.e. on
 I have attached photo of the clone Uno board recently acquired and I am working on a Mac OS X 10.7.5 I have sourced the solution from http://javacolors.blogspot.com/2014/08/dccduino-usb-drivers-ch340-ch341-chipset.html Which suggests to install 340/341CH drivers and run a sudo code. When I plug in the Uno board the Arduino IDE still does not show under port selection the dev.tty.usbserial and as such I cannot contact or upload any command to the Uno board. Been trying for a whole day.. please help if you know a possible solution This is the board: I bought the board from this site: http://www.aliexpress.com/ite
 Im new so I might be making a stupid mistake but Im declaring: char dollars; at the begging of file afterwards Im reading a data from a web page printing it to my serial. That part work well. The data returned from the web page is a number 55 for instance. The number gets printed correctly to the serial. But when I try to save the complete number it changes. for instance when I get 0 from the server. The printed result is 10. here is the important part of my code: unsigned long lastRead = millis; while www.connected &amp;&amp; millis - lastRead &lt; IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS { while www.available { char c = www.read; Serial.printc; dollars = www.read; lastRead = millis; } } www.close; Serial.printlndollars; while the www.read is repeating each of the returned characters it works fine Serial.printc; but when I save it to the dollars char var it get garbled up i
 I community! I need put ATcommand to my XBee from my atmega using a xbee library and a function that I have found in internet. I think the ATComand is ATD50 to change the DIO5 to value 0 disabled.

 For my next project Id like to use a battery pack to power my Arduino.I would also like to get a small solar panel and charging module to charge these batteries when possible during the day. What is the right type of battery for this kind of application? What are the differences given this context? What are the factors I need to consider when choosing a rechargeable battery for this application? 
 I\ve read so much about Thyristors Triacs and Rectifiers on the last days that I\m almost undertanding my schematic but I\m not there yet - I need some help. Overview : I\m making a home automation project with Android and Arduino. To make that happen I\m using this Dimmer shield. Everything is working fine i.e. I\m being able to variate the intensity of the lamp of my room from a SeekBar on my cell. Problem : I want to understand how the dimmer shield works by reading and interpreting its schematics which you can see here . Dimmer Shield basic functionallity : If you checked the photo of the dimmer shield on the link above you saw that there are four terminal block. Two are called Vac and two are called LOAD. On the Vac terminals we simply
 Is there any reason why is my /dev/cu port always busy? How can I fix that? It happened on both Uno clone and Spark Core. The problem is I\m having issues doing serial communication. Where as a programmer I\m seeing something like dropped packets with /dev/tty port. I did a quick test running it on Win 7 a loaner PC it works fine... The code for now is extremely simple. It waits for a command and write a response. String str = String30;void setup{ Serial.begin9600; str = ;}void loop{ if Serial.available &gt; 0 { char inChar = Serial.read; if inChar == \\\n\ || inChar == \\\r\ || inChar == \z\ { str.trim; ifstr == READ { String x = Stringrandom27 45 + + Stringrandom45 300 + + Stringrandom35 250; Serial.printlnx; } str = ; } else { if str.length
 Is it possible to delay a task inside a function that is called only once meaning it\s not inside the loop without using delay? This library I\m using for reading sensor measurements via serial has a delay in it. I want to get rid of it but I don\t how to do it because the library\s function is not looped. I guess the simple solution would be to move the library functions inside the loop so I can do a simple check with millis and run the delayed part as soon as 250 ms have passed. I would like to improve this library though and do a simple single call for sensor data that doesn\t not hold up the entire program. This is the function with the delay: uint16_t COZIR::Requestchar* s{ Commands; // empty buffer buffer[0] = \\\0\; // read answer; there may be a 100ms delay! // TODO: PROPER TIMEOUT CODE. delay250; int idx = 0; while

 On an Arudino Uno the PWM pin 3 is connected to the gate pin of an N-channel MOSFET STP16NF06L . The source pin is connected to ground of a 12V power supply and drain pin connected to a multimeter. The other end of the multimeter is connected to the positive terminal of the power supply. Question: When Arduino varies its PWM output from 0 to 255 the multimeter reading goes from 11.50V to 12.10V. Why isnt it 0 to 12V? When the FET gate is connected to the Arudino pin that outputs either 0V or 5V the multimeter reading is as expected at 0V and 12V respectively. 
 I am using a Arduino Due. I am doing a project on Visible Light Communication. I need to convert a binary data into a PWM Signal. Can anyone suggest me a method of generating that PWM Signal based on the binary data given? Thank You. 
 Background: I am looking into automation and I have realized that many of the devices I have around my house transmit 315mhz to their specific controllers. I know this from reading the labels on the back that say 315mhz Question: Is there a way I can use a 315mhz receiver with an arduino to view the signals and log the data based on what happens and mimic certain actions with the transmitter? In other words can I program the reciever to display every bit passed through 315mhz that is in range? I know the virtual wire library parses the data before I receive it but I dont know to what extent? If I just dedicate the arduino to watch that pin and print results will that tell me what is being sent? Thanks Very Much Joel 
 Im trying to interface with a serial device utilizing Serial1 pins 1819 on the Arduino Due. The normal serial port Serial is working just fine and is acting as a debug port at the moment - Its also able to communicate with the serial device without a problem when using the normal port. I noticed that within the libraries for the Arduino hardware the avr directory contains HardwareSerial files for the Megas multiple serial lines but the header file under the sam director does not. Simply a declaration of the HardwareSerial class with no elaboration on Serial1Serial2 or Serial3 like the Megas header contains. Has anyone modified the libraries to set up the Arduino Dues multiple serial lines? Thanks in advance! 
 In this forum thread on arduino.cc http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=107375.0 they talk about it not being possible to get 800 x 600 video in color with the arduino. My case is a bit different: I don\t care about color it can be black and white / grayscale. I don\t need 800 x 600 just 640 x 480. I can do with something like 2-5 frames per second. I don\t need it to be processed by the arduino just transmitted through an ethernet shield. In other words it is possible to transmit simple video just enough to handle eg. bios remote? 
 I am working on home automation project. A network consists of one master device and many maybe 10-20 slave devices all communicating via these RF modules . I am using arduino in slave devices. Master will be based on raspberry Pi most probably. Slave nodes can be sensors or switchesto control household electronics. To and fro communication will include data such as : a Turn off bulb 1 b Turn on TV c Set the bulb brightness to 34% d Temperature reading is 23 degree Celsius etc. From security point of view imagine there are similar other networks in the range and one network must not interfere with another. As such I need to implement some sort of authentication whenever each data transfer takes place between master &lt;---> slave. What logic do you suggest for this process? There can be cases when data has not been received successfully b
 I know that its fairly easy to change the emulate keyboard and mouse by Arduino. But Im quite specific about the goal I would like to achieve hence I would appreciate if you could advise me which components Arduino compatible I am going to need to have such a built: Physical usb keyboard --> Arduino via usb IN --> keys remapping for example pressing q will return ctrl+3 or more advanced action --> Arduino USB OUT which I can directly plug in to my computer and receive modified keyboard commands. To sum up I just want Arduino to work as intermediary. Will simple Arduino Uno + USB shield do the work? Thank you a lot for your support! 
 I need to modify the WiFiWebServer example http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/WiFiWebServer on the Arduino website but I am having some trouble understanding the code. I am hoping to get some advice from the community on the client-server relationship in this example so I can better modify it to suit my needs. The problem I am having is the jump between server commands and client commands. Initially I see server commands; server.begin in setup and server.available in the loop. The commands quickly shift however as nearly all the other commands in the loop become client.println\s. I understand the initial client commands that deal with whether the client is available and whether it is still connected. The part I don\t understand however are the client.read and client.println commands. Even client.read makes some sense to me since I want some communication from the client side but why does th
 I went &amp; impulse-bought a Maplin Bluetooth shield yesterday. It comes with a little tiny book containing examples and uses the softwareserial library in these; I can load them and get the Arduino &lt;-> PC communication going OK however there appears not to be a response from the bluetooth part of the device. The LED lights much as the booklet says it should. I did see it return some odd characters one time just the once.. Given that the system appears to be alive I don\t want to give up &amp; take it back; however the output from Google is not promising and my trial to date isn\t either - so I\m looking for positive news that this product does actually work for someone somewhere? I\m using the built-in serial in the IDE to talk to it not X-CTU as they suggest
 I have a tv remote that I want to connect to an Arduino so that I can send a series of commands to the TV using the remote. I would like to open the remote and solder transistors or a Transistor Array in place of the buttons. I have never done this before so what do I need to be aware of? I think that I will need to power the remote using the Arduinos power supply but I am a bit foggy on the details. 
 I have a kind of theoretical question. Lets have an Arduino Uno connected through USB that does a lot of Serial.print-ing. Then I disconnect it and I dont see anything on the Serial monitor but the Arduino is still working. I can judge by the blinking lamps and so on. Now I see that all printing goes through HardwareSerial::write from the Arduino core. There is this statement: // If the output buffer is full theres nothing for it other than to // wait for the interrupt handler to empty it a bit // ???: return 0 here instead? while i == _tx_buffer-&gt;tail ; It means that if the output buffer is full the Serial.print will hang there eternally. However this doesnt happen. I guess somebody is consuming the data and to be more precise in ISRUSART_UDRE_vect. It seems as the only place where within interrupt _tx_buffer->tail can be changed. Otherwise the code would loop endlessly in HardwareSerial::write. This interrupt USART_UDRE_vec
 I\m building an audio circuit that will play VGM files Video Game Music. I have it working with two different vintage IC\s such as the SN76489 and the AY-3-8912 . Currently my design is using an Arduino Micro and two shift registers for the data buses and direct pins for the control pins on the audio IC\s. On average an audio IC has 8 pins for the data bus and 4 pins for the control or address bus. This varies per IC. Some might be 3 some 4 some 6 etc. Bottom line even with the 20 IO pins on the Arduino I will quickly run out of pins. I thought about serializing many shift registers and basically pass 64 or 128 bit numbers to spread out to the multiple IC\s but this sounds ugly. I\d like to be able to support maybe 6 IC\s which could be 60-80 pins. I also have an Arduino DUE which has many more IO pins. But then I have to deal with the 3.3v lim
 So I have a 5V Arduino Pro Mini which is running the logic behind a multi-DHT22 sensor array and using that input to control a 12v 24mm fan 12v 0.16 A.

Will this actually just generate a high burn whenever the arduino is on to convert the 12v-5v? What
 I purchased this CO2 sensor a while back: http://www.sainsmart.com/sensors/eco/sainsmart-mg811-gas-co2-carbon-dioxide-sensor-module-sensor-module.html The module has four pins Vin GND Dout and Aout. I assume Dout and Aout are digital output and analog output respectively. Other than that the sensor came with no datasheet instructions or tutorial. I also searched online but fail to find anything useful. I\m going simple for now just hooking up the sensor module to Arduino board. I know I can probably connect the output pins to the analog pins and analogRead them. But what I am looking for is how to convert the raw data readings into CO2 levels in PPM. Like a formula.Also I\m curious as to how the digital output works... Thanks for any help! 
 I have an Uno and I can play all I want with it just using a USB cable. Then I got two Nano clones and they both show the same behavior: When I connect it to the USB cable which leads to my PC it blinks a few times then seemingly does nothing. I am also not able to connect to it via the Arduino IDE. If I then connect an external power source to Vin and Gnd it wakes up and blinks forever and I am able to connect to it. Is this just because I got a cheap clone? Or is this really the accepted / expected behavior? 
 I\m new to electronics and unsure whether my design below will work as intended. XBee Series 2 and Arduino Pro Mini 5V are used. There are 4 LEDs each with the following roles: LED1 : Flicker when transferring data to XBee LED2 : Flicker when transferring data to Arduino LED3 : Turns on when XBee is powered on LED4 : Turns on when Arduino is powered on Also will it suffice to use 3.3V LEDs for LED1 LED2 LED3 and 5V LEDs for LED4 ? 
 I\m new to Arduino and still learning the basics.I tried reading water level by using this sensor I left it in the water for about 5 minutes then I noticed it changing color some parts darker than otherlike the water is still over it .So my question is do Water sensors really rust ? or is it my own imagination?

 In the project of guiding a sight disabled person in a known environment we need to have a precise way of figuring out where the user is. Our current solution is to use WPS. This is however our first project with Arduino and were not quite sure if were going the right way about this. Were thinking of getting a compass component and such but is there something we should know before advancing further in the project? EDIT: Additional information. The system is placed on the user most probably strapped to the arm. The communication to the Wi-Fi beacons will be done from there as well as the calculations. The environment is supposed to be as complex as an exposition hall but we can aim higher. Budget range is around $100 Arduino itself excluded. A UNO is already provided to us.

 Im working with the robotics lab at the university to try and find a replacement for the obsolete Handy Board. Were considering purchasing arduinos because of their ease of use but we cant seem to find shields with compactly integrated capabilities as the handy board DC motor outputs analog/digital inputs and a physical interface such as knobs and buttons. We did consider purchasing expansion boards but the final product would be too bulky. Here are the complete specs: Allow direct control of at least 4 DC motors Accept digital and analog sensor inputs Simple UI LCD buttons/knobs Be as compact as possible including the batery Does any one know if such a thing exists? 
 Im using GPIO api and configure it as input pull down. It reads value 0. However when I use power meter and connect this gpio and ground it shows 3.3V.

 Reading over the datasheet it appears the longest it can shutdown for is 8s so should I just keep a counter in the loop method that checks if its run 38 times and then execute the code I want? Would this wakeup every 8s hurt battery life much if its doing nothing but incrementing a counter? 
 I hope that this is not a silly question. I may be hoplelessly optimistic in asking but is there any way to power &amp; display information onto a LCD Display from an Arduino Uno.... Without the breadboard? I am working on a hardware project that has very strict space constraints and the breadboard is simply not an option. 
 I use a 2.8 TFT Touch Shield v1 and I want to read some data that were stred in sd and plot them with the tft. When the following code is ordered to access the data.

 I recently bought Freescale\s FRDM-FXS-MULTI-B and have been trying to integrate it with an Arduino UNO. The board descriptions say that it has the shield layout that matches that of an Arduino shield. So in theory I should be able to integrate it fine. The problem comes when I plug it in and try to program the Arduino. As soon as I plug it in the board resets and hangs. If I try to upload a simple code just reading the analogue signal from the light sensor the IDE hangs when uploading. Sometimes I can fix it by removing the shield and pressing the reset button but sometimes that doesn\t work: the computer doesn\t recognise the Arduino on the port and the IDE removes the port from the Port Selection option. When I do remove it and it resumes functioning normally and I re-attach the shield the board resets and hangs again until I g
 I am working on a project using my Arduino mega2560 that triggers a solenoid maximum of three solenoids my camera and my flash maximum of two flashes. The core routine is there and working. Now I want to refine this by adding a menu and 16x2 LCD with 6 buttons up/down/left/right/select/reset. This is meant to be so the user can change the default values for: - the amount of solenoids to be used max 3 - the amount of drops per solenoid max 3 - the time between drops and - the time between active solenoids. The layout of the menu is there but not yet coded. My default values for solenoids used droplet size droplet timing solenoid timing camera delay and flashes delays are put in an array. Through the menu the default values will be presented to the user. He can accept select button or change the value within certain limits using the up/down buttons. The question is what is an easy for a beginner like me to program way to a
 I\m a new to all things electronics and I\m having trouble using a DFRobot Bluno V2 with a DFRobot Relay Shield for Arduino V2.1. For testing purposes I\ve done the exact same circuit as represented in this diagram: http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/Relay_Shield_for_Arduino_V2.1_SKU:DFR0144#Connection_Diagram But it is not working. If I send HIGH signal to D10 or press the S4 button on the shield the circuit does not close and the LED doesn\t turn on even though the LED4 next to the relay on the shield lights up. If I do same circuit connecting the LED to D10 directly ie. without using the relay it works fine. I\ve also tested this with the other relays on the shield and the results were the same. Does anyone know what might be the issue? W
 Hello I have an Arduino Yun and I brew beer. I would like to log the temperature of the beer at all time during the fermentation process final stage. This means the thermometer would have to remain in the beer during this time 10 days. The temperature would be &lt; 40 degrees Celsius probably around the 20 degree mark. Question: What temperature sensor would be best suited to this task? It must be: Food grade Can be used in alcohol for extended periods Can be hooked up to Arduino i.e. add a library and ready to go Thanks Dan. 
 What type of connector does GROVE use? I\m interested in wiring some old sensors so they\re compatible with GROVE so I first need to identify the connector so I can buy the housing and pins to crimp. It looks to be some type of JST connector but there are many different sizes each with incompatible pitches and a lot of retailers often advertise them incorrectly. Unfortunately I can\t find any documentation of the connector on Seeedstudio\s site. 
 I am trying to connet a tri axis accelerometer LSM303DLH to arduino UNO using the libraries taken from the following links https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LSM303DLHC and/or https://github.com/ryantm/LSM303DLH but none of them work. Using the following connection: SCL on A5 SDA on A4 Vin on 5V Gng on Gnd. I should be able to see the values of the accelerometer but the serial monitor is empty. I\ve tried inserting a few print in the libraries to understand where the execution stops basically after a Wire.endTrasmission the program doesn\t go forward.How can I connect the accelerometer using I2C? 
 I am trying to interface an optical mouse sensor OM10B with an Arduino Uno. The sensor is 3.3V and the Arduino runs at 5V but also has the 3.3V source. I found this very detailed homepage where someone has done this and I am trying to follow it. However he is not using an Arduino and I do not understand the final circuit well. Since he does not write at which voltage he is operating his ATMega 3.3V or 5V I am unsure whether I can follow his instrcutions without modifications. Here is the circuit diagram from that homepage: I don\t understand the usage of the Zener diodes at the bottom in combination with the 150 Ohm resistors for the SPI interface. Is this a logic level converter to connect it to an ATMega at 5V or what purpose does it serve? If i
 I just purchased an Adafruit Wifi Shield CC3300 and strapped it onto my Arduino Uno board. I\m running this basic sketch that I found to test the functionality of the Wifi Shield: http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoWiFiShield#toc1 Of course in my home I have Wifi so I expected this sketch to show my Wifi name. However it doesn\t. Instead I get this output on my serial monitor: Init...** Scan Networks **Initializing Wifi...MAC: 0:0:0:0:0:0Scanning available networks...** Scan Networks **number of available networks:0Scanning available networks...** Scan Networks **number of available networks:0 It just keeps going forever detecting zero networks.I even took the Arduino and stood 3 feet away from my Wifi router. Still nothing.I even tried making my cell phone a Wifi hotspot and holding it right next to the Arduino. Still nothing. And why does it say the MAC Address 0

 I want to write an Arduino program that simply recieves a string via the I2C wire library from a master Arduino then waits for a request and sends that string back. Here is my code: #include &lt;Wire.h&gt;void setup{ Wire.begin4; Wire.onReceivereceiveEvent; Wire.onRequestrequestEvent;}String data = ;void loop{}void receiveEventint howMany{ data = ; while Wire.available{ data += charWire.read; }}void requestEvent{ Wire.writedata;} I read in the API that the write function accepts a string but I keep getting a No matching function for call error. I tried to simply replace Wire.writedata; with Wire.writetest; and that worked without error. Why is this the case? 
 We\ve got an Arduino KY-032 Obstacle avoidance sensor and have spent a decent time searching and researching to find a detailed data sheet/manual to figure out how it works; but there aren\t any detailed information on the module. The one of the few instructions here says that the potentiometers on the chip are used to adjust the distance but I\ve tried all different settings and the maximum I can get is 10 centimeters. I\ve tried different surfaces with different reflectivity levels but it doesn\t really differ much. Any idea how to increase the distance on this? Anything to do with the Enable jumper? Update: Here\s the related code to the obstacle detection: void loop { // check the network connection once every 10 seconds: val = digitalRead buttonpin
 I am starting simple but for some reason I cannot find any examples online and I stuck with my task. I have a usb midi keyboard Arduino Yun and a synthesiser that can accept midi via usb. The problem is that the synth doesnt send a voltage through its usb and the keyboard has only one usb that is used to send midi data and its powered via it at the same time. My idea is to use my Yuns USB host which sends voltage too to power my midi keyboard and grab all incoming midi data from the keyboard then simply pass it unchanged through to my synth. Where do I start? Do I need some python code for it or everything can be done with sketch code? Ive done few arduino projects but I am new to usb host functionality . This is my first step later I would like to also convert usb-midi to 5-din-midi old school connection but thats different story. Can you guys help me and point into the right direction? Anyone done something similar on Yun? Ive seen some exa

 I am using the following components to build simple motobot: Arduino Uno Arduino motor shield servo sonar HC-SR04 magician chessis DC adapter with 4 AA batteries. All works fine while USB cable is plugged. As soon as I unplug USB cable servo and sonar stop working although motors connected to motor shield continue rolling. From what I read around internet motor shield operates with 7-12V voltage. I need 5V for sonar and servo. So they both are connected to 5V pin on the shield board. How could I overcome this issue? 
 I am making an arduino game and the requirement is that my arduino reads 4 analog values from the pots. I dont know whether I should use an external battery supply or the 5V from the duino itself. I dont want my ICs to get fried or nothing happening at all.

 I was wondering if someone could try and solve a major problem I\ve been having with a brand new Arduino Robot similar to an Arduino Leonardo. Any input would be very much appreciated! I\ve been working with an Arduino Robot on a summer internship for the last week with no major problems. However a couple of days ago it stopped running programs and couldn\t be detected when being plugged into the computer. When plugged in or turned on the LCD turns on with nothing displayed on the screen and the power LED also switches on. However no program is run I had a working program involving the LCD uploaded at the time it stopped functioning which would normally run. Also when plugged in the Arduino is completely undetected by the computer with the \Serial Port\ option under Tools grayed out the device not showing up in device manager and no signs that a device has been plugged-in. I\ve tried 3 different US

 I had fun making a 3x3x3 led cube. Now I want to build a bigger one. I\d like to find out the best IC for it. I\ve seen that some projects uses multiplexer like 4051 or 74HC595. I\d like to make it at least 8x8x8 so the multiplexer has to easily be spotted in cascade possibly supporting also the pwm to fade the leds. And I\m a little bit scared by the real time with a lot of LED.. do I have to solve the problem in hardware with a faster multiplexer o via software? 
 Is there any free/open or commercial/paid Arduino IDE Sketch Debugger not Atmel chip factory standard tool set with Breakpoint and Variable read/set capability? I read about VM on web. Is there any similar product? 
 I have a raspberryPi and Arduino connected via i2C. On the RPi I have a python script that takes int values and simply sends them to the RPi which in turn echoes them back. I am trying to debug this since I am unable to send ints larger than 255. One thought was that I might be able to connect the arduino slave directly to my Mac and then use the Arduino serial monitor to help with debugging. Unfortunately the python script will not run because I assume i2C can only be run on a Linux kernel. Am I mistaken? This is an edited portion of my python code import smbusimport time# for RPI version 1 use bus = smbus.SMBus0bus = smbus.SMBus1# This is the address we setup in the Arduino Programaddress = 0x04def writeNumbervalue: bus.write_byteaddress value return -1def readNumber: number = bus.read_byteaddress return number 
 I am currently working on a Arduino project that combines an InertiaOne IMU sensor board from Atmel with an Arduino UNO and two motors driven by a Makeblock driver board. All sensors communicate using I2C with different addresses. My issue is that the program runs just fine for a while everything between 1 second and 2 minutes but suddenly lock up inside the Wire.requestFrom-function that handles I2C communication. More specifically I believe that the code hangs at one of these points in the Wire library the code is a direct copy: ...// wait until twi is ready become master receiverwhileTWI_READY != twi_state{ continue;}...// wait for read operation to completewhileTWI_MRX == twi_state{ continue;} As far as I know there are only two units that utilise I2C in the system both of which are embedded onto the InertiaOne circuit board. What I find very strange is that reading these two sensors works just fine when no motors are running

 This is an extremely noobie question but I have a 5V at 2A power source. This power source is going to be powering 6 Sharp IR distance sensors20-150cm and a few other low current consumption sensorsie Xbee. My question is if it is safe to simply use that power source without some sort of resistor between the power source and sensors? also the IR sensors have a analog output. Is that same to plug into the arduinos analog pins?

 I\m basing my project off of this Instructable but I am using a different LED matrix and I\m afraid a different driver chip rendering the author\s code useless to me. This is the matrix I am using. I know the matrix is working because I can upload some test code from Adafruit and all colors light up perfectly. I upload the sketch to my Arduino and get no errors. I then run the sketch in Processing and end up with nothing getting displayed to my matrix. Is there a setting in the code I need to alter? Is it a compatibility issue?

 I am using a grove GPS http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_GPS I attached the GPS to Serial1 of Arduino Mega 2560. The baudrate of the GPS is set to 9600. Library wise I am using TinyGps to parse the GPS data. The GPS receiver can only get a valid data if it can see a clear sky. I read uBlox documentation and it states that I can use A-GPS. So my question is how do I actually set the Grove GPS that is attached to my Mega to use A-GPS? 
 Im completely new on Arduino I bought a Rampos 1.4 and an Arduino Mega 2560 to build a Prusa Mendel 3D printer. But when I connet the Arduino via USB to my computer I open the software and I click to upload the example blink but it does anything and says Uploading to i/o board. This happens when I use Arduino 0022 and then when I use Arduino 1.0.5 r2 that is the problem: avrdude: stk500v2_ReceiveMessage: timeoutavrdude: stk500v2_ReceiveMessage: timeoutavrdude: stk500v2_ReceiveMessage: timeoutavrdude: stk500v2_ReceiveMessage: timeoutavrdude: stk500v2_ReceiveMessage: timeoutavrdude: stk500v2_ReceiveMessage: timeoutavrdude: stk500v2_getsync: timeout communicating with programmer I dont know what is happening and I dont know what to do. 
 I\m pretty new to this whole thing so please excuse my lack of familiarity with terminology. I\m looking to build two buzzers of sorts. One will live on the ground floor and the other will live on the fourth floor. There is wireless internet as well as wired internet available to connect the two. This is the basic idea I might put more frills in later. Both buzzers to have one button and one led. I want it so that once buzzer one\s button is pressed the led lights on both buzzers will light up. Then only when buzzer two\s button is pressed will the led lights on both buzzers turn off. I\m pretty tied up on the two arduinos communicating with each other. Is it possible to do something like that? 
 I coded a ring buffer for my Arduino to buffer data from either the SPI or TWI ports. In the .h file I used a pointer for the buffer: typedef uint8_t *ring_buffer_t;typedef uint8_t ring_count_t;typedef uint8_t ring_index_t;typedef uint8_t ring_size_t;typedef struct ring_t { ring_buffer_t buffer; ring_count_t count; ring_index_t head; ring_index_t tail; ring_size_t size;}rint_t;int ring_initring_t *r ring_buffer_t buffer ring_size_t size;// other function prototypes to add and remove from the ring buffer There is more code to handle adding and removing from the buffer but I am simplifying here. Then in my .c file I have: #include&lt;string.h&gt;void ring_initring_t *r ring_buffer_t buffer ring_size_t size{ r-&gt;buffer = buffer; r-&gt;size = size; r-&gt;head = 0; r-&gt;tail = 0; r-&gt;count = 0; // clear out the buffer memset cheaper by 12 bytes rather than for loop memsetvoid *r-&g
 2 days back I bought Arduino Yun. Im able to flash Led on 13 pin. And Im able to flash Led on Bread board connected to A0. Im able to run linux commands. Now I want control A0 pin using Linux/Python program. Is this possible? I read many documents. But I didnt find thing related to this. How I can flash the LED using Linux programs? 
 Im currently trying to write to and read from an 25LC256-E EEPROM with my Arduino Uno via SPI. Ive made a program which is supposed to do this but I only get weird answers. Im sending in a Serial-string.This string should start with w r or e depending on what action I want to perform. The second character should be an int between 0 and 3 to determine witch PIN I should use as slave currently Im using only 1 slave so the int should always be 0.The rest of the string gets written to the EEPROM one byte/character at the time. What am I missing? CODE: #include &lt;SPI.h&gt; #define WREN 6 #define WRDI 4 #define RDSR 5 #define WRSR 1 #define READ 3 #define WRITE 2 // Multiple slaves for future project const int CHANNELS[4] = {10 8 7 4}; String readResult; void setup { Serial.begin9600; channelSetup; // Set all slave pins in CHANNELS to OUTPUT and HIGH SPI.begin; SPI.setD

 I am building a small wireless controlled robot using the Arduino and the raspberry pi. It works by the user wirelessly connecting through to the raspberry Pi using vnc or some other form wirelessly and using the user inputs to send a command to the Arduino which controls the motorised wheels. SO for example if the user presses the up button a \W command is sent from the Raspberry Pi to the Arduino which then reads it and pushes the wheels forward. I was looking to use one of the new Arduino-Raspberry Pi bridges to connect the two to make it easier to use but I am not too familiar on how they work. Had a few question such as: 1 How exactly do they work connection wise? 2 is it possible to write one python code in the raspberry pi that when run can load the specific ino code into arduino? 3 which bridge would be the most suited for my project? eg: Arduberry alamode gertduino etc? Sorry really new to the raspberry pi and need to find a sol
 Having recently entered the world of Arduino I am seeking to make as my first project a ball that will sense my dogs approach and roll away. I can handle the rolling part but I have been unable to find a sensor that will work when fully embedded in the ball so the dog cannot bite or swallow it. This means no ultrasound or infra red or normal proximity sensor will do. My best bet - an inductive proximity sensor with a metal object attached to dogs collar is only effective at a maximum distance of 8 cm and that is far too little. I need something that activates at say 1 foot. Any ideas anyone?

 Trying to modify the native mouse methods so that it can use absolute rather than the relative values it currently uses. This is so it can function as a touch screen pointer and NOT a mouse. Am using this modified HID.cpp file here https://github.com/nospam2000/Arduino/commit/7b77d1e84d7b80819f049e5fd6e7bafa0d06521f#diff-0dd97502971c8a55546092b93abd32caR349 Mostly works but the author has mapped to the maximum and minimum possible int values -32768 to 32767 and no matter what permutation of values I use with the native map method I can\t get it to work properly.

 I am trying to control an RGB LED strip with an Arduino. I have followed the tutorials in both of these websites: Using MOSFETs: https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-led-strips?view=all Using LED Amplifiers: http://www.instructables.com/id/LED-Strip-Controller-w-LED-Amp-Arduino/ I have tried both setups and none of them work for me. When I try the setup with the MOSFETs I am able to control each color but the blue LEDs are dimmer than the red and green and therefore I can\t mix any colors with blue. When I try the LED Amplifiers I am not able to control any light at all. Only the blue LEDs light up but the red and green dont. A
 I want to learn AVR C programming instead of arduino programming. I have an arduino UNO board and few Atmega328 chips that I bought and Atmel studio for programming. Can I UNO board as programmer to flash the chips from Atmel Studio? Or any other alternatives? 
 I have a program where the Arduino acts as an Ethernet Server. The client continuously sends packets which is of the following format Start Byte=0x7E;Some Data/Command Bytes; //Can be of varying lengthEnd Byte=0x7A; Some packets take more time to process than others. So my question is what is the best way to read the bytes of the memory so that we always work on one packet at a time.I can read in data from the buffer one at a time and loop through till the END BYTE is reached but it doesnt seem a very efficient way to get the packets. I would be interested if someone has better ideas on how to read in packets one at a time from the buffer in the most efficient way possible. 
 In this post it was mentioned that to get the Arduino IDE to support an ATmega328 only the ATmega328P is supported: I should mention the Arduino way of doing this is to create a new boards.txt file with this chip and add not change the avrdude.conf file. This will allow programing either from selecting the correct board. but that is another subject. After a great deal of research in the past and attempted modifications to boards.txt and avrdude.conf I arrived at the conclusion that the Toolchain doesn\t support the ATmega328 therefore the changes will have no effect. Can anyone confirm that they have successfully found a way to make these changes so we can avoid the need for a work-around? 
 I am relatively new to Arduino platform and not know much. I am working on a Bicycle speedometer with turn and stop indicators. I am planning on connecting an inductor magnet to calculate the rotation of my front wheel while providing the following services from the same arduino board: Input horn and turn indicator switches. Output to turn indicators. Stop light when one of the brakes isapplied. While I am sure of how to connect all the sensors except the magnet I am not sure how to handle the various inputs and the outputs at once. I must be able to horn and stuff while the indicator blinks at a regular interval all the while the monitor keeps displaying my speed and distance covered. Any reference or help would be greatly appreciated.Thanks in advance. Bharath. S.

 I am new to Arduino and SIM300/900 world. But I see that there is a possibility of building a vehicle tracker approximate locality since I will use GPRS network location using just these 2 boards. My question is is my assumption correct ? Can I build a vehicle tracker using just Arduino Nano and SIM300 mobule ? Is there a board that has both of them on one board so that I dont have to buy them separately ? Cost is a major factor on the decision.

 I am a true beginner here. Trying to build a slot machine type game and am in the beginning stages. Found a RNG for LCD code and tweaked it a bit to get three digits to display randomly. Worked just fine. But what I\m trying to accomplish is getting a red LED to blink when none of the RN match blue when 2 RN match and green when 3 RN match. What is happening now is that the LCD will no longer generate random numbers when I press my button UNless I hold the button in for a couple of seconds. As soon as the random numbers appear my green led flashes briefly then the red and blue blink opposite of each other red on 1 sec off 1 sec blue on 1 sec off 1 sec repeat......green only briefly when random numbers change. So after hours and hours of searching goggle and trying to figure this out on my own I am turning the folks who know what they are doing :Please tell me what I am doing wrong.... Any help would be greatly appreciated. So why did the RNG stop working with a single pr
 I\m building a small library that will be used and production and released open source. I\m paying a lot of attention to the best practices to make sure this code is reliable and easy to use. I also would also like to make this easy to edit. I\m having an issue with the naming scheme of the whole project. There are a few Arduino naming quirks. If I have a sketch called mylib : ...I can\t create a tab called mylib.cpp . However I can create a file called mylib.h ... ...The folder and main sketch file must be the same name as the folder it is in ...The sketch name and folder cannot contain any spaces. Well why are you creating a sketch for a library? The Arduino IDE won\t open a .cpp file unless there\s a sketch in that folder and you have to open the .ino / .pde file in that folder. I\m trying to get this to work with the Ard
 I want to make a system that always have the same current about 1ma in a water with silver electrode. At start it will be purified water so conductivity will be really low. But with time silver particle will be released in water raising his conductivity so if I dont lower the voltage the current will raise too meaning that bigger particle will be released which I dont want too. So is there any way I can measure low current and adapt voltage with the result since deducting resistance wouldnt be hard. I know about ASC712 but It seem that he cant be precise enough steps of 13ma max to my use. I precise its not that long Im trying to get back in electronics with arduino so many school things have been forgotten. 
 I have been struggling to pass an array of data integers from an Ardunio to Raspberry Pi over I2C using the Wire Arduino and SMbus RasPi libraries.

 I\d like to use an H-Bridge AND send PWM signal. I\ve used this schematics: http://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/Labs/DCMotorControl and use the PWM signal inside the enablePin . But the H_Bridge is getting very hot. Am I wrong? EDIT: I\m using and H-Bridge but not for driving a motor instead I\m driving a peltier cell like this one: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10080 . What I\m trying to achieve is to have a fixed peltier cell and to have in the same side sometimes hot sometimes cold. This behaviour is done by switching the positive and negative with the H-Bridge. To control how much cold and how much hot I\m using PWM.

 I want to know why toroidal inductor is being used in the RFID reader described in this site: http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/DIYRFIDReader . I feel that toroidal inductor wouldn\t be very effective in grasping the changes in electromagnetic field changes. 
 I want to power down my Olimexino as much as possible and only wakeup on a pin-change interrupt. I removed the 3.3V/5V jumper so the processor does not get power and 3A were displayed so the voltage regulator is really a low power variant. What I have done: #include &lt;avr/power.h&gt;power_all_disable;set_sleep_modeSLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN;sleep_enable;sleep_cpu; This resulted in still using 220A. Now I disable the ADC too: ADCSRA = 0; which reduces it to 100A. Ive tried to disable further ADC-stuff using ACSR = 0;ADMUX = 0; and tried to disable ? the Watchdog Timer using WDTCSR = 1 &lt;&lt; WDP3; but without any further improvements. The datasheet for the 32u4 suggests to disable the Brown-Out-Detector too but I dont seem to be able to do that using code but only by setting some fuses which is not possible directly using the Arduino IDE. Any further ide
 I wanted to use both TMRpcm and VirtualWire with ATmega328 in an Arduino-like board I\m making but both libraries use TIMER1. I wanted to use each lib for the following purposes: TMRpcm: play a WAV sound from an SD Card; VirtualWire: to receive commands from an RF remote control. TMRpcm Advanced Features Wiki has a section on how to use TIMER2 instead but I couldn\t get it to work. They also say: Notes: This is usually not the best solution. So before I spend any more time on this I would like to hear what you guys have to say. So my question is: is t
 I am doing a light speed determination experimsmt. Lightspeed is around 3*10^8 m/s. For this I need to measure time interval between 2 light sensors in nanoseconds Somewhere about 50ns. Is this possible using the Uno R3? I know the clock is 16MHz only but is the clock irrelevantto the topic? If it is not possible Some tips would be helpful. Thank you. Sorry for irrelevant tags. No suitable tags found. 
 I would like to be able to design an Arduino circuit for a fridge monitor that would have a temperature sensor a small speaker to emit a sound when the temperature changes past a threshold and an LCD screen showing the current temperature. I have found a few examples online but I would like to know why components like capacitors and transistors are used in their circuits so Id be able to design similar circuits myself. I found this list of electronics topics: Basic Theory Basic Passive Components Passive Circuits Discrete Active Components Active Circuits Integrated Circuits Digital Logic Analog Signals Outputs Inputs Digital Electronics Some of these things like digital logic seem unnecessary in such a project but obviously some others are useful but I dont know which. Id like to know what it would be useful to study so I can understand the reasons for
 I am using Arduino uno. My data is storing into EEPROM whenever i run my program it will store multiple data depend on the loop. For my program it calculate 10 sample in 0.1 sec so 100 sample in 1 sec. How can i know how much memory i can run?

 This is a home heating system hack. I want to add an arduino in-line between my thermostat and air handler; and possibly between the air handler and outdoor compressor. The long-term goal is to post long-term statistics to an RRD web page run time power consumption temp etc. and control the blower without the heat automatically when we are burning our wood stove. The product is a Nordyne IQDrive notable in that the equipment comes with 5 separate brand logos to adhere to the equipment: Tappan Frigidaire Westinghouse Nutone and Broan. At this stage all I want to attempt to do is to tap the serial links and record the conversations. I would prefer not to shoot myself in the foot. The System Field Wiring Instructions describe both links as serial. The wiring diagrams label the connection points as: air handler interface board --> [description] --> thermostat G --&gt; GND --&gt; C - --&gt; DX- --&gt; B- + --&g
 I\m new to the Arduino world or the electronics world for that matter. I have the Arduino Yun and the WifiStatus code works fine so does the HttpClient. But every time I try to run the bridge sample code all I see is the pin 13 led light up and the browser commands don\t work. PS: I have updated the open-wrt to ver. 1.3. Any thoughts on why this would be happening? Edit 1: I have tried to reboot arduino using the hardware switches as well as from the web console. The blink sketch works fine so does the WifiStatus code and the HttpClient code. The other problem I face after every few uploads is that the IDE is stuck at Uploading.... I have tried to give it more time even an hour. But then I had to unplug it from the Mac and restarted. Then it worked but only for a few times. But this problem is not specific to the Bridge code. The uploading issue has occurred with other sample code as well. But at least the code worked. Edit
 I currently use my Arduino to program Attiny85. As I have one of these USB-to-TTL adapters I am wondering if it is possible to program Attiny85 with it to free up my Arduino. I know it is possible to program Atmega\s with such a thing. If it is in fact possible to use the converter as a simple programmer for Attiny\s how should I connect the converter to the Attiny? 
 I\ve tried different USB cables computers ports and none of them can detect my possibly bricked Mega 2560 R3. Nothing shows up at all in the Device Manager not even Unknown Device. When the board is plugged in via USB the L LED is constantly lit as well as the ON LED next the reset button. I came up on this article here and I gave it a try which I believe is putting it in DFU mode. However I\m not having any luck with this. http://www.wayneandlayne.com/blog/2011/02/16/fixing-linux-firmware-issues-on-arduino-mega-2560/ Any one have any ideas on where to go from here? I\m very new with Arduino. 
 I have my Arduino Uno connected to the PC via USB when prototyping. I am developing a thermometer with memory using DS18B20 sensors. When PC is shut down there is no power on the USB and the Arduino is off. Sometimes when my PC is turned off for several hours and then when I turn it on the Arduino is started but it behaves strange - the program is showing buggy values on the display looking like if there is some bug in the sketch. However when I upload the sketch again it works fine. The buggy values are the averages for the run computed simply by summing a float and dividing by int. What I see is e.g. instead of seeing something around 23.5 I see 85.1. The current values read from the sensor look OK show 23.5 as expected but I cannot tell for sure if perhaps some value read early might be wrong. It is not easy to reproduce I see it only sometimes always when powering Arduino on after several hours without power. My first idea is either the

 As the title says there is any program that can simulate an arduino due? I like the design of Proteus 8 but he cant simulate it. Only the arduino Uno R3 Mega and another one that I forgot the name. 
 I have looked a lot to find PCB boards that house a arduino sim300 or 900 for GSM and GPS. I am hoping that I can find one board that has it all. I found one board GBoard Pro but this is way too expensive to consider as a alternative to a android phone. I rather buy an android phone for my customers and put to rest issues like servicing repair and breakdowns. 
 I\m a beginner with Arduino and i have acquired the Arduino UNO R3 board. i have followed the instructions on arduino website in order to install the board however it fails and still remains as an unrecognised device. consequently arduino IDE reports that COM1 is not found and the \ports\ menu is grayed out. steps i have tried: 1 install the Arduino 1.0.5 IDE - the installation failes near the end when installing the arduino board 2 install the Arduino 1.5.7 BETA IDE - the installation is successful but arduino device is still unrecognized. 3 i have tried manually installing the drivers by letting windows search in the arduino IDE installation folder/drivers/ - it reports that the best driver is already installed - usb unrecognized device 4 i have tried installing the drivers by manulally loading the .inf files from the IDE installation fol
 Not exactly Arduino-specific but if you want to get a daily usable device instead of a floating wire connection on your table you eventually want to put your Arduino-based device into a nice casing. What are the different types of cases that people use? I found soap cases as well as kitchen boxes used one large cheese box from Mepal Rosti. 
 Im trying to make a class work with Arduino however it doesnt seem to trigger properly. The code is compiling perfectly and its supposed to control the leg of an hexapod .

 I am having problems controlling a 3.5 Floppy Disk Drive with an Arduino Uno. I have the floppy disk drive powered with a computer power supply that is switched on and the Arduino powered by my computer\s USB. I have cut apart the ribbon of a 34-pin IDC connector to be able to route the pins to my Arduino. I am able to turn the floppy disk motor on and move the read/write head back and forth but I am never able to read any pulses from the Track-0 or Index pins. I have pins 7 15 17 19 and 25 from the floppy all grounded to my Arduino and I have pins 8 16 18 20 and 26 from the floppy connected to my arduino as output pins so I can control the drive. I am expecting the Index to pulse when the disk motor makes a rotation and for Track 0 to change when I am at the outside of the disk but they are both always LOW. Am I missing something? Here is the spec I found for the back of the floppy disk unit 2 /REDWC
 Im not sure if Im being really really stupid but why doesnt this work? void setup { Serial.begin9600;}void loop { for int x; x &lt; 8; x++ { for int y; y &lt; 8; y++ { Serial.printx; Serial.printlny; delay100; } }} When this does: void setup { Serial.begin9600;}void loop { for int x; x &lt; 8; x++ { Serial.printlnx; delay100; }} The first produces no output over Serial whereas the second one prints out the numbers 0 to 7 as expected. Im using a Teensy 3.1. 
 I\m using FastLED with a custom board built around the ATMega32u4. When I set it to use Software SPI everything works fine but when I use hardware SPI it just hangs whenever it tries to write out the data FastLED.show. I originally mocked this up on an Arduino Pro Micro and it worked fine there. That makes me think that it\s a hardware issue but as I mentioned SPI output does work but only when bit-banged. Which really doesn\t make much sense. I tested this by also just using the built in SPI classes and I get the same thing. No luck with hardware SPI. Anyone else ever see something like this? The schematic of my circuit is below. 
 I\m using a 5V Arduino Pro Micro schematic . For my project I\m using the VCC pin to output power to an external device. I need VCC to output 3.3V to the external device. Can I open jumper SJ1 to reduce the voltage of the VCC pin without affecting the operation of the other parts of the unit? 
 I have arduino UNO hooked up with wtv020-sd-16p and it works fine playing audio files - speaker is connected right to the WTV020s pin #4 and #5. However volume is rather low. So I have ordered LM386 amplifier module. I have wired its IN pin with WTV020s pin #2 AUDIO-L. But no sound comes out of speaker. I can hear only some scratches from the speaker while arduino is running. LM386 is pretty easy only VCC IN and GND pins so there is nothing much to screw up. I am wondering what could be the problem ? Thanks for any help or hints in advance. EDIT: Only to note when WTV020 is playing sound speaker goes completely mute. When it doesnt play sound little scratchy sounds can be heard from speaker. Maybe it could help with analysis ? 
 thanks for taking the time to read this I really appreciate it.I am very new to Arduino and the Micro controller world so please forgive my ignorance. So I have an old 7 segment display that displays outside temperature what i want to do is read the temp into the Arduino and light up an LED if the temperature gets high and a different color if the temp gets low. I know i can use a thermometer and plug it into the Arduino and go from there but that would be cheating. So my question is can i read each pin of the 7 segment display and translate that into a number into the Arduino? Task: Read a dual 10 pin 7 segment by jumping wires into the Arduino. Setup: I am using the code and setup found here: http://blog.rastating.com/using-a-7-segment-led-display-w-arduino-uno/ to display a number 21 for testing p

 I want to use xbee\s to communicate between two different arduinos. I\m using this tutorial as a guide to setup my xbee\s. I\ve already used XCTU to setup one xbee as a router and another as a coordinator both in ZIGBEE AT mode. I used XCTU\s terminal feature to verify that info was being sent and received properly. Basically I have both arduinos connected to the same PC via USB cables but the communication is taking place through the Xbee\s. I also made sure to disconnect the TX &amp; RX wires when uploading the sketches to avoid an AVRDUDE error. I wanted to test the communication by sending a hello world message once every five seconds from the router to the coordinator. To do this I wrote the following code: //Code for Arduino attached to Xbee in Router AT modevoid setup{ Serial.begin9600; }void loop{ Serial.printlnHello World!; delay5000;} and <c
 I am new to Arduino and computer programming in general so I apologize if this question looks silly.

 Im driving a large stepper motor via a GeckoBoard G213V and arduino UNO and I have that mostly working fine. However Id like to release the stepper so it can swing freely. Theres two reasons I want to do this: 1 Most important I want the rotated object to naturally swing back to the 0 position thanks to gravity.2 The motor gets hot - Id rather not juice it when it should just be sat at 0. Anybody know how I can do this? Im using the AccelStepper library so a solution compatible with that would be ideal. 
 I need to create a millisecond capable visual clock - I will use the clock for visual frame synchronization of multiple cameras. I found this project but it seems to use a LED display that only has resolution of one 1/100th of a second. Not sure if the digits can be shifted to show milliseconds. I guess I need to use LED instead of LCD display because of the ms refresh rate? Can someone help with my project please? I am a SW programmer and have zero experience in HW programming. So I am new to Arduino too - I have not done any project at all yet. I do own neither Arduino nor LED display. Thanks! 
 The pinhole camera is a 420TVL 3.7mm Passive Infrared Detector Color Covert Security Camera . Can I use this camera with an arduino creation?

 I\d like to make three arrays of the same length. According to the documentation Arrays must be defined as int myArray[10]; where 10 can be substituted for a known length another integer or filled with an array {2 3 5 6 7} . However when I attempted to declare a value int arrSize = 10; and then an array based on that size int myArray[arrSize]; I get the following: error: array bound is not an integer constant . Is there a way to variably determine array sizes or do I just need to hardcode them? I was taught hardcoding is bad and something to avoid at all costs.

 I\ve set up a DC motor connected to my Arduino Uno with the following layout. I\m using a 1.5V - 3V DC motor that was purchased from RadioShack. Here is my code: int controlPin = 9;void setup{ pinModecontrolPin OUTPUT; Serial.begin9600; while!Serial; Serial.printlnReady; }void loop{ ifSerial.available{ int s = Serial.parseInt; ifs &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; s &lt;= 255{ Serial.printlns; analogWritecontrolPin s; } } } If I connect the motor through the Arduino 5V pin it only hums until I set the speed s to 200 or greater. This seems odd because I\m supplying 5V. As a next step I decided to try a 9V battery I don\t really care if I fry the motor I just wanted to experiment. Of course this is over the recommended voltage but I assumed if I sent a low enough signal s through pin 9 it might not destroy the motor. However to my surprise when I connected the 9V battery

Where can I get more information . Many thanks in advance. edit: Update boot loader size for different boards 
 I bought an OBD connector from Sparkfun to try to connect to my vehicle via arduino. I\m just beginning and am not sure if I can just connect the connector pics to the arduino directly or if there is some other required hardware? Does anyone know if I can connect directly and why or why not? 
 According to official web info bootloader sizes are 0.5 2 and 8 kilo bytes for UNO Pro mini and ATMega2560. I believe all three boot loaders do similar job of receiving serial link data and write to Flash memory. UNO and Pro mini use same/similar ATMega168/328 chips but boot loader size are 0.5 and 2 KB. ATMega2560 apparent has a more advanced MCU which presumably should use similar or even less memory to do the same task but the size is significantly large at 8 KB . Why sizes differ? Small difference may be explained by different development teams but should be that much different from 0.5 to 8KB. 
 As stated in www.Arduino.cc FAQ Can I use an Arduino board without the Arduino software? Sure. It\s just an AVR development board you can use straight AVR C or C++ with avr-gcc and avrdude or AVR Studio to program it. For UNO/Pro MiniATMega328 and ATmega2560 does these two chips support JTAG type some chip manufacturers may use different name programmer / hardware-based debugger in same manner as the ST-Link/J-Link programmer/debugger where one can load code into the MCU and perform hardware break point and single stepping? Example as in STM32 development board with ST-LINK programmer / debugger where the chip has built-in debug circuit that communicate with ST-Link. Many thanks in advance. 
 Say I wrote a compiled sketch to EEPROM then read it. Could I run the program from EEPROM? I guess the question is: Can an Arduino run software not in flash memory in the middle of executing the software in flash? 
 In order to allow bigger user program size is it possible and advisable to reload Pro Mini with the boot loader originally designed for UNO . This will save 1.5 KB flash space UNO boot loader is 0.5KB Pro Mini is 2KB. Using a smaller boot loader is an intermediate step to get more space while still enjoy the easy benefit of the Arduino IDE and many library/code example. Of course ultimate step is to remove all boot loader only small saving of 0.5KB if above is possible and switch to ATmel development environment ATmel studio which is complex but programmer has full control of everything. Did I miss anything in the followings? I tend to believe that it is possible as a same ATMega328 chip is used in both board b Pro Mini is essentially cutting UNO into two halves the MCU and the USB/Serial converter now use external USB to Serial converter If the Pro Mini board is reloaded with U
 I am experiencing problems when I put parts of my code into custom functions and then have Arduino Mega 2560 run it. The code works fine when I put it all in the void loop function but when I create new functions then call those functions in the loop function it doesn\t do what I want it to. Here is the code where I put everything in the loop function /*Location.txt: Date/Time Latitude deg decimal Longitude Altitude mSpeed.txt: Date/Time Speed m/s Heading deg*/#include&lt;TinyGPS.h&gt;#include&lt;SD.h&gt;#include&lt;SPI.h&gt;int CS = 53;long latlon;unsigned long time date;int yeartinseconds;byte month day hour minute second hundredths;unsigned long age;char dataString[20];TinyGPS GPS;struct GPSstruct { String dateTime; int timeseconds; float C_lat; float C_lon; float C_alt; float heading; float speedmps;};void setup{ Serial.begin115200; Serial1.begin38400; pinModeCS OUTPUT; if!SD.beginCS { Serial.printlnF

 I have an ArbotiX-m Arduino board and have followed the setup guide on Trossen robotics all the way to the 5th step. I have a Mac running OS X 10.10 and use Arduino 1.0.5. I installed the necessary drivers and copied the files to the Sketchbook directory.

 I am making a Electronic Dice. I have 7 LEDs to form the output and this works fine. My problem is getting a random result on the output. int die_face = 1;void loop{ if analogReadBUTTON_PIN == HIGH { paintDieFacedie_face % 6 + 1; } die_face += 1;} The problem is that roughly 95% of the time I get a 1. Most of the time it\s not a 1 it\s a 2 or very rarely a 3. I\ve tried paintDieFace with millis%6+1 too but always get the same result.When it\s painted with random17; I get 1 2 or 3 100% of the time. Is this some sort of timing issue? I just don\t get it. Just to clarify - The paintDieFace function is working perfectly I\m logging the result to serial too. 
 Where is a simple program that demonstrates unidirectional data transmission over a pair of nRF24L01+ radios? It should have adequate output so that a beginner can determine that the transmission is working properly. 
 I have an Arduino Mega 2560 with a GPRS seeedstudio shield and an USB Host CircuitsAtHome shield which work fine when powered with USB or with an adjustable voltage regulator set at 8V. When I set this voltage regulator at 7V minimum voltage from the spec to get the better efficiency I am still reading 5V and 3.3V on the pins of the Arduino and all the leds of the Arduino and the GPRS shield seems fine but the USB Host CircuitsAtHome shield seems to not work properly.I cannot debug it using the console because if I plug the USB cable everything works fine... Why 7V fail while 8V is ok? The adjustable voltage regulator can provide up to 5A which is plenty.

 Im using my Arduino Leonardo as a Mouse but Im experimenting a strange behaviour.I put my mouse at -1 -1 absolute coordinates and then I execute this code: Move.movecom[curr_cmd_id].x com[curr_cmd_id].y 0; where that point is 334 180 relative coords and I checked it through Serial console Now the pointer is actually moving to the right but then it stops. Lets say it reaches the point 334 0. Then I tried: Mouse.movecom[curr_cmd_id].x 0 0;delay500;Mouse.move0 com[curr_cmd_id].y 0; but still the same behaviour. Then finally I tried this one which it actually solves my problem but its a dirty solution: int i;fori=0; i&lt;com[curr_cmd_id].x; i++{ Mouse.move100; delay1;}fori=0; i&lt;com[curr_cmd_id].y; i++{ Mouse.move010; delay1;} Could anybody help me in understanding whats going on here?

 Im using the Adafruit SD shield with a Mega board and wrote a simple program to log data. I am outputting a constant stream of data at 115200 baudrate from another Arduino to the Mega. The data output is mostly good but there are places where some data are skipped. These skipped data usually occurs around a file flush. Ive tried playing around with the flush frequency and the soft buffer size but to no avail. Im not sure what these hiccups are caused by and would like some help. void loopvoid{ while Serial1.available { softBuffer[i] = Serial1.read; i++; } if i &gt;= SOFT_BUFFER_SIZE { for x = 0; x &lt; SOFT_BUFFER_SIZE; x++ { logfile.printsoftBuffer[x]; } logfile.flush; i = 0; }} 
 I got my hands on a RFD22102 RFduino DIP and want to connect it to an e-paper display like the EM027BS013 or equivalent in the 2.7-3.0 inch range. I am pretty new to this.

I am looking for a solution with minimal soldering and want it to be as compact as possible. Thanks in advance! 
 In Linux Fedora 20 Arduino I want to use the Timer library from here from which I have downloaded the folder Timer-master.zip but when I try to import it I get the Arduino message that it cannot be imported because its name includes characters other than plain ACSII letters and numbers.

 is it possible to perform an action maximum x times per hour on the arduino? I made a automatic water sprinkler that sprays when the humidity is lower than 50%. but if the sprayer performs this spray more than 4 times an hour the humidity wil be to high and wil rise to fast.so is there a way to restrict the amount of times an action is performed per hourand then if the next hour comes the sprayer can perform his sprays 4 times before it stops again sorry for bad english this is not the language I speak and type mutch

 Is it possible to write an Arduino program to an AVR chip that does not have teh Arduino bootloader installed? What is the process to do so? 
 Im sorry if this isnt the right area. Teensy uses the arduino ide. Ive seen some people show off the 144 mhz and 168 mhz option in their ide. I read in the Teensyduino 1.19 release notes that the options were added but not enabled. I would like to know how to enable it or if I somehow downloaded an older version. P.S I get the 96 mhz option. Thanks ahead of time!

 I want to build an arduino-based RC Tank which should be controlled with a notebook or smartphone Android. Bluetooth would be an easy solution but the range is a bit short for a RC Vehicle so I want to controll it via WIFI. I found a ton of examples and tutorials on how to do that but all of them reqire a router which both the arduino and the Smartphone are connected to. Any idea on how to directly control an Arduino with an smartphone via WIFI?

 I have been trying to upload bootloader on ATmega328P SMT package on a custom PCB using Arduino Uno as ISP I was quite successful.

What kind of bootloader should I use for this particular package? How should I upload the sketches into the chip? 
 I am attempting to interface a OV7670 camera to an arduino Due. I am fairly new to this although have been programming for many years. I need to generate a clock signal for the camera at a minimum of 8Mhz - I realise using the pre-scalers I can only get an approximation but I am cool with that. I finally got a nice steady 3mhz signal from the sketch below note that the irq routine for TC6 is not used and will be removed very soon as soon as I get home. I think I have a conceptial problem with the timers because as I am initialising RA and RC to 1 and telling via TC_Configure to toggle the line and because I am using CLOCK1 42 Mhz I believe with those values of RA and RC I should be getting a 21ish MHZ signal. Ie RA starts at zero. First CLOCK1 tick. at second/48000000 interval. RA Goes to 1 COmpares to RC Because they are equal resets RA to 0 and toggles TIOA6 Next Clock1 tick occurs..... As I said I am only getting a 3Mhz signal. <pre
 I am using an Arduino Uno with the Arduino as ISP sketch to program an ATtiny85. I followed this tutorial to set up to program the ATtiny and successfully got it to run Blink and an interrupt-free version of my program. I then added an interrupt triggered by a button and got it working on the Arduino Uno with a software debounce in the ISR. Now I want to run that sketch with appropriate pin changes on the ATtiny. Which pins correspond to which interrupt IDs for attachInterrupt ? Or can I not use attachInterrupt ? If I can\t how do I do set up an interrupt on an ATtiny85?

 What software is available for use with AVRISP and USBASP on ATMega328 2560 for read/write fuse flash and EEPROM for UNO Pro Mini and Mega2560 board? a fact question not opinion Which software did you use? Did it work straight forward like the software did all the needed auto select? Does it need human selection for options etc. on the above 3 boards? Do I need WinAVR installed before able to use the ISP software? 
 I am working on prototyping an underwater navigation system with Arduino. Its going to be used to track movement underwater from a starting point and then be able to tell how to get back to that point or relatively close. The unit would only be going a few hundred feet underwater. I am using an Arduino Nano is this going to be sufficient? Also what IMU would you recommend? Im sure it will need to at least have a 3-axis gyroscope 3-axes accelerometer and possibly a 3-axis magnetometer. This does need to be relatively affordable. Currently Im building a unit that can go underwater and just record data onto an SD card so that I can take the data and map it out to check the IMUs accuracy error margin along with test various filters on the data. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. 
 I\m building something that will mostly run on bare ATmega328p at 8 MHz as described eg. here but sometimes I need to run the same code on an Arduino. I need to initialize the DHT library depending on the clock frequency. For simplicity I\d rather detect the running environment runtime in the program itself. So is there a straightforward way to detect the clock speed from fuses? or some other difference between a stock UNO board and a bare ATmega328p using the internal 8 MHz clock? 
 I am simultaneously using a LEGO sound sensor in pin A5 and a RadioShack Tricolor LED Strip Product #2760339 in pin A0. The sound sensor alone works as expected producing values based on volume running only code to read the value and output to the serial monitor. However when I upload the program to use the LED strip read the sensor value and output to the serial monitor the sensor value caps at 174. The program given to run the LED strip can be found at http://blog.radioshack.com/2013/06/tricolor-led-strip/ The code I added to this was pulled mostly directly from the AnalogInOutSerial example provided by Arduino.

 Im building a Arduino Nano based underwater navigation system using an IMU and various sensors. The only problem with this is that I cannot get the speed or velocityat least reliably and it would help the accuracy of my navigation system immensely if I had accurate speed to go off of. Does anyone have any ideas on how I could measure the speed of my Arduino underwater? Ive seen some people recommend paddle wheel like sensors but this needs to be accurate for slow movement.

 I am testing this basic button example from the Arduino tutorial page. This circuit lets power flow to pin 2 when the button is pressed. When the button is not pressed the power goes through the resistor to ground but my question is: why would you even need the connection to ground? Can\t you have power flow from 5V to pin2 or just have NO connection at all when the button is not pressed? 
 I need to measure voltage between 0-10 volts using my Arduino Due. I have an ADS7805p chip which I believe will work but am not sure how to wire it on my breadboard. Im used to just using the chip on the arduino but that only goes 0-5 volts and I cant loose the resolution by converting. Can someone please point me to or instruct me on how to wire something like this to my arduino? 
 This documentation states that the CE and CSN pins can be specified. Can I specify A0 and A1 as these pins? 
 I recently started programming with Arduino and and currently Im making a project to read RPM and Speed of my car using Arduino Uno. So far I got everything working but the speed value does not show properly. I have used one hardware counter and two interrupts in this project. Timer 1 on pin 5 - Count pulses from cars ECU to calculate speed. Int0 on pin 2 - Read ignition pulse to calculate RPM. int1 on pin 3 - 5v in from headlight switch to control the brightness of the display MAX729 7 seg 8 digit. I can get the proper reading from RPM and also the brightness control is working properly.

 I am using an Arduino Leonardo together with a GY-521 breakout board like this one schematic for an MPU 6050 . I am currently trying to get the DMP Version of the examples from Mr Rowberg to work. For all my tests I use these connections: GY-521 -> Leonardo VCC -> 5V 3.3V has the same behaviour SDA -> SDA SCL -> SCL GND -> GND The raw sketch works fine I can read out the sensor data. For the DMP version I think I need to connect the INT pin to pin 3 on the leonardo to allow the MPU6050 to trigger an interrupt. But as soon as I connect
 I\m new to arduino so my question may sound stupid.I bought a wifi shield which says that the chip is RN-171 I/RM.

 Im currently playing with Arduinos hardware timers and a question came to my mind. Let me explain it a bit. Lets suppose I want a certain function to execute every 1024 clock ticks. AFAIK I could achieve this in several ways playing with the prescaler value for Timer2 and its CTC: Setting the prescaler to 1 and the CTC to 1024 Setting the prescaler to 8 and the CTC to 128 ... Setting the prescaler to 1024 and the CTC to 1. All these ways would achieve what I want but which one is more efficient? Or it doesnt matter at all? Thanks in advance for sharing your knowledge :P 
 Im working on a small project that is creating me a headache.

 I am experiencing some very strange behavior with my arduino. I have a switch-case statement in the loop method and the break methods are not only breaking out of the case block but also out of the loop statement. Is this normal and if so how can I edit the structure so it doesnt do that?My code structure looks like this: void loop{ switchint i{ case 1:{ //do something break;// this also breaks out of the loop method. } }} 
 Arduino sketches usually feature a setup and loop function. Are these functions only provided for convenience or do they actually have special purposes? e.g.: are some operations disallowed or allowed in setup and loop Are these two pieces of code equivalent: Classic void setup { pinModeLED_BUILTIN OUTPUT;}void loop { digitalWriteLED_BUILTIN HIGH; delay1000; digitalWriteLED_BUILTIN LOW; delay1000;} Without loop void setup { pinModeLED_BUILTIN OUTPUT; whiletrue { digitalWriteLED_BUILTIN HIGH; delay1000; digitalWriteLED_BUILTIN LOW; delay1000; }}void loop {} Is it possible to write code without either setup or loop providing for example
 I have been playing with the RF22b which is a small UHF transceiver sold by Sparkfun. I connected it to a 9duino the Leonardo-compatible board developed by Borderless Electronics last year and sold for $9/unit. I tried a simple Arduino program that would broadcast Hello World in one of the default formats that RF22b supports. Listening to the specified frequency with a simple handheld Baofeng UV-5R if you\re interested and heard nothing. I tried pretty much everything I could think of and nothing worked. On a whim I pulled out the 9duino and replaced it with a SainSmart Uno-compatible board and it worked just fine. All the variant programs worked just fine too. So at this point I am not so concerned about fixing it with the 9duino and am more curious about why this is and what I might be missing. 
 I have been using my arduino uno for many months and it worked very well even till today morning but an hour ago I tried to upload a sketch and arduino IDE showed my this avrdude: stk500_getsysc: not in sync: resp =0x00 at first I thought maybe I burned my atmega32 chip but I bypassed reset and gnd with a jumper wire and opened serial monitor and my atmega32 still printing serial dataso problem must be something elseand also my led13 isn\t blinking.Is it problem with bootloader?if so how can I reload bootloader in my board without using another arduino? 
 Im developing a project Data logger that requires that the Arduino remains on for several weeks. Is it okay to leave it on for about 6 weeks? Do I need to frequently reset it? 
 I have loaded an example sketch that came with the installation of the Arduino software onto my Uno. void setup { Serial.begin9600;}void loop { int sensorValue = analogReadA0; Serial.printlnsensorValue; delay1; } From this time TX light is continuously on. Its remaining on even after resetting it. How do I end void loop so that TX light goes off. 
 In a lot of the sample code online people add the line Serial.begin9600 in the setup block. When I look up what Serial.begin is on the official documentation it says that it controls the bit per second data transfer. So the obvious question is why not use 28800 the highest transfer rate? Why do people settle for 9600? What is the limitation here? 
 When I started Arduino I did not expect that everything must be contained in an infinite loop. I thought I could just write something like: motor start -> motor stop. But in actuality what I get is motor start -> motor stop -> motor start -> ... forever and ever. What is commonly done to stop a servo after it is in a desired position? Do I use servo.writedesired position to keep it from turning? Do I detach the output wire? What are some of the risks involved? 
 Every time that I open the Serial Monitor my arduino UNO seems to go back to void setup . Is it a normal thing? 
 Has anyone ever accidentally or inadvertently connected connected the supply port with the ground port with a wire? Does Arduino provide internal safety to prevent the circuit board from shorting out?

 Id like to build a simple GPS system. It should be very little. For the software side I will build an API so from my PC/smartphone/whatever else I could ask the GPS system where it is located I think Google provides this kind of feature. How can I do this? My main problem is the GPS and the its building. Id like to build the smallest thing possible because I have to hide it. My idea is to hide this GPS system in my bike: Id like to locate my bike if someone stole it. As you can see internet is a problem. Im not asking to design anything. I would only know what I need to build a basic GPS system that has just the feature described. What do I need? Is it possible to do it? Does GPS require Internet connection? I would know if I could make it or not without internet access. 
 I was playing around with my Arduino Uno R3 board with Sublime Text 2 &amp; Stino as IDE I am not sure if it is my code is the problem or if I broke something...

 So recently my company threw away some rather large and reasonably old laser printers. One was a LaserJet 9050dn the other was a Epson printer/scanner combination. Being a little industrial I thought let me salvage them and brought them home. I managed to salvage a couple of stepper motors. However I am having huge trouble is getting them to step properly. So lets get into the details. Components used: 1x Freetronics eleven Arduino Uno compatbile 1X H-Bridge driver shieldFreetronics rated for 40V/2A max. 1X Old scanner power supply which has a output of 24V/2A. Currently there are two stepper motors I am interested in using. They have the following part numbers: 1X MITSUMI M42SP-4N 1X Minebea-Matshushita 17PM-J212-G2ST Just to keep this short I am going to focus on the Minebea-Matshushita 17PM-J212-G2ST. I have been unable to find exact matches on these serial numbers when looking for datasheets
 I have found bunch of information about how to hack an RC car with PCB; and how to control an Arduino from a receiver. Also how to run a servo from an arduino but im looking for a way to make an arduino send signals to a 27mhz 3 channel reciever Using 3 potentiometers to decide servo location. Is there any information about this somewhere? - I have an old transmitter lying arround if needed. Links pointers anything is welcome.

 I have the following circuit and want to use the Arduino Mega 2560 as an debugger for an other Microcontroller. So I am looking for the code to redirect the UART input from P17 RX2 to the serial USB and the data coming from the serial USB to the output of P16 TX2 
 On the Arduino website it states that the analog pins read voltages from 0 to 5 volts default and return a value from 0 to 1023. One can also set the range with analogReference. However this is probably assuming the Arduino is running at 5 volts. If one powers the board with say 4 volts will the analog reference still be 5 volts default or changed to the input voltage of 4 volts? 
 Im building an electrical system for my EBike. My bike has 2 power sources one is the 48 volt battery the other is a 12 power converter coming off the battery pack. I need an arduino shield that has 4 switching channels. 2 that can take in the 48 volt and switch it on and off and two that can take in the 12 volt and switch it on and off. Something that can take the 12 volt to power the arduino uno would be nice but I can find a chip to do that if necessary. Since these are lights normally off would be more more efficient but with the power consumption we are talking about i can probably run the battery all day to the point of dry and the fets eat all of 50 feet worth of power staying closed. Does anyone know of anything like that? I found several shields out there like this but all of them seem to be setup to take 1 voltage input and switch it between the 4 or 6 fets

 I am working on building a pure sine wave inverter using an Arduino Uno to output two PWM signals for the top and bottom half of the wave. Currently I am outputting pre-calculated values with an interrupt as PWM. This seems to be working but I was wondering if anyone had any feedback on my design and whether there is a better way to go about doing this. I will also need to incorporate feedback into this to vary the max PWM duty cycle and I am worried the ATMEGA will not be able to keep up do this fast enough.

 I would like to control normal household appliances like lamps pumps etc. using my Arduino with up to 5 A. I looked a little around but it seems that most relais draw more current than the Arduino is capable of supplying. How can I switch an 230 V AC current using my Arduino? 
 Im trying to control two DC 3-6V motors with a HG7881 driver and an Arduino Nano but the Nano is always resetting if it has the same power supply than the driver. Im connecting the batteries to HG7881 Vcc and Nano Vin and also same ground. If I power the Nano with USB and the driver with batteries then it works but thats not a good solution for me. So the question is is there any way to make both driver and Nano work with the same power supply? Thanks!

 I have the problem that I want some Arduinos communicate in a wireless mesh network using the VirtualWire library but also be able to receive and send codes for my rc sockets using the RCSwitch library. I have some Arduinos using VirtualWire and some devices using the hx2262 IC for RC-Decoding. I want to send and receive messages between the Arduinos each message must be at least 10 bytes long and also be able to send and receive messages from the hx2262 RC power sockets. My idea would be to use VirtualWire for inter Arduino communication and RCSwitch for the power sockets. Both work fine as long as I do not put both libraries on the same controller. Does anyone have an idea to solve that problem?

 I recently started with a domotic project I began creating a lock opening with a RFIDcurrently I\m trying improving the code I took from http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=256260 but I have some question about the security of this system or any in the domotic way. First I know any system is 100% secure. starting from there I was thinking what happens if someone known that the system is built in the arduino platform and has some knowlege about it that person can create a sketch upload to the board and make opening all the pings? they will have access to that room or thing I\m protecting or trying. This is just a excercise I don\t want to go in depth about the external security that the board/system must have. So searching topics about it I didn\t find anything to help in the solution of this theoretical problem. I read some articles about the bootloader and I think th

 I am interested in learning about arduino. What is the quickest and cheapest way to find out if this is something I can and want to do? 
 I\m a longtime C programmer. I\ve also done a little C++ a little Java and a LOT of Objective-C but am fairly new to the Arduino platform and it\s IDE. So far all my sketches have had a single source file. I see how you copy libraries into the libraries sub-folder of your Arduino source folder either from the Mac finder or from the IDE. I\m trying to understand somebody else\s project The Camera Axe device for high speed photography. in that project there is a folder for the entire sketch cameraAxe. In that folder there\s a file called cameraAxe.ino which follows the usual convention that the sketch\s main source file needs to be inside a folder with the same name. However for this project there are 17 other source .ino files. Looking at the main cameraAxe.ino file it only #includes 2 files EEPROM.h and DogmCA.h both using the convention of enclosing the filename in angle brackets so the compiler knows to look in it\s libraries dire
 I am working on assembling the ROFI robot from Project Biped http://www.projectbiped.com/prototypes/rofi and I have not been able to run any arduino program as they will not function correctly. To be more specific when I attempt to run 12 servos on a single Arduino Mega the servos twitch uncontrollably and do not move to the positions which are set in the program. At the same time the power light on the arduino mega blinks and does not turn solid as opposed to if I use less than 11 servos when the pwr light is solid. I predict it might be the power source but after checking the batteries with the multimeter they check out to be fine 7.6 V. The circuit is pretty simple I am using a servo shield connected to a 6V regulator connected in parallel to two 7.2 V 1350 mah LiPo batteries. The arduino is connected through the dc power jack to the same circuit in parallel. Here is the code... <

 There are existing projects that allow the Uno and other devices using the ATmega8u2 to operate as a USB MIDI HID such as MocoLUFA . Unfortunately as far as I am aware these require uploading new firmware that isn\t compatible with programming via the Arduino UI. Are there any similar projects for the ATmega32u4 Leonardo Micro? Is it possible to use an Arduino as a USB MIDI HID while still being able to program it as normal? 
 I just ran into this article: Arduino: What adapter? . It says that the external power supply should be 9-12V. That really surprises me since my Arduino Uno can also be powered via USB which is 5V. Later he talks about a 9V pin. But I can only see a 5V and 3.3V pin on mine. Is he talking about a different version of Arduino? Judging from the picture his Arduino looks slightly different from my Arduino Uno R3 but I can\t tell which version is on the picture. 
 Eventually MBR0520 shottky diode died after short. Arduino Nano stopped working. I don\t have anything to replace it so i just replaced it to wire and my arduino works again. I can\t find and clearly understand what it does originally and what downsides i have now without it? Arduino Nano scheme 
 While wiring up my new Arduino Uno R3 on a proto-board I accidentally shorted the 5V pin directly to Ground. The LEDs immediately turned off and connection was lost. It was powered by USB connection. After 3-5 seconds I removed the short. The LEDs have remained out and I havent been able to reestablish connection with my computer since. Ive unplugged and re-plugged the USB cable and tried the re-set button plenty of times. This short shouldnt have fried the board... what happened? How can I get my Arduino working again?? 
 Im writing a software that can receive data from Arduino via Bluetooth. My software is pretty fine now at least it can pair with my hardware but when I try to test whether it can receive data via Bluetooth Im stuck. My Arduino receives temperature readings from a sensor at Analog pin 0. My Bluetooth module HC-05 connects with Arduino at Digital 0 and 1 RX and TX pin respectively as default. I dont know how to push data from Analog pin 0 to the Bluetooth module. Thanks in advance for any suggestion. 
 Just to make sure I don\t set my board on fire is there any information out there about the maximum current per pin/pin group on an Arduino Micro? This page states I can get 40mA per pin but are there limits on group of pins? As stated here there are pin groups which should not exceed 100mA. But could not find anything about that in the ATmega32u4 datasheet or any other Arduino Micro related websites. 
 I need to incorporate a battery monitor using a 10 led bar graph. I am powering the arduino with a 7.4though it reads 7.67 V lithium polymer battery through the arduino`s power jack. The goal is to monitor that battery. How would I go about doing this? I have a LM3914 driver to use if I want but I am clueless as to what to do. 
 Every time I design a serial protocol to be used between two arduinos I feel a bit like Im reinventing a wheel. I wonder if there are any best practices or patterns people follow. This question is less about the actual code but more about the format of the messages. For example if I wanted to tell an arduino to flash its first LED 3 times I might send: ^L1F3\\n ^: starts a new command L: Defines the command L: target this command to an LED 1: Target the first LED : Command line separator new value in this message to follow F: Flash sub-command 3: 3 times Flash the LED three times \\n: End the command Thoughts? How do you usually approach writing a new serial protocol? What about if I wanted to send a query from arduino 1 to arduino 2 and then receive a response? 
 I am a novice Arduino programmer and am currently having trouble with a SH5461AS 4-digit/7-segment LED when using it with an Arduino Uno. I have struggled to find an accurate datasheet/tutorial of any kind for this particular model It is the LED without the colons in between digits 2 and 3 but I believe I have it figured out. I currently have it going through a HC595 shift register but when I removed the register and connected the LED directly to the board the problem remained. My code below is with the shift register; I am displaying it this way because it is simpler to view and I thought it would make it easier to debug. I can display a single digit at a time correctly. However when I try to display 2+ digits at one time they are in the incorrect order.For example I can count 1-9 on the first digit then 1-9 on the 2nd digit and so on and everything displays correctly other digits are off. But as soon as I try to display multiple digits they are in the wrong or
 I\m trying to get an arduino board to detect simple free fall condtions. Currently I have a 9DOF sensor https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/lsm9ds0-hookup-guide and am able to get the raw data from the sensor. However I am unsure what to do from here onwards. From what I manage to gather there is an alternative sensor ADXL345 accelerometer that has an inbuilt free fall component. I have tried modfying the code in such a way that it will work with the sensor I am using but to no avail. The free fall detection does not need to be extremely accurate/precise considering there are many fall/jerk patterns. It is just for a proof of concept for a project of mine. With that in mind any suggestions on how to proceed will be greatly appreciated or if I should just get the ADXL345 accelerometer. Thank you.

 Im trying to connect Arduino Leonardo to an Android tablet. I would like to make the Arduino send commands using pushbuttons or a slider for example to the tablet to switch between pages to select a file on the desktop to scroll up and down the screen etc. Thanks.

 I wasn\t sure where to ask this question but since it\s actually an Arduino project I\ll try it here. I want to upgrade my old car with ultrasonic parking sensors: I\ve already bought HC-SR04s as sensors and started to play on my breadboard. But what I\m still unsure about: if I place them in my car\s rear bumber how can I make them resistent to rain or dirt or something like that?As pictured on Wikipedia the sensor is covered with a small piece. But what could I use to cover the holes in the bumper without interfering with the ultrasonic measuring?

 Ive been playing with my APM 2.6 and wondered for future projects if its possible to write code that allows me to switch from copter to rover mode and back while in the field. Is this possible? It would be best if all it took was the flick of a switch on my transmitter. 
 Read web information but they are confusing apparently due to different version of the board and software combination. Pointer for the above said version will be appreciated PC side is Arduino IDE 1.0.5 on windows 7. 
 Id like to compare performance between different microcontrollers 328P 32U4 Intel Quark -Galileo Gen1- MSP430G2552 and MSP430FR5969 with a relatively big calculus >10s using only integers and then another test using floats as well. So I thought a good couple of tests would be to try to calculate PI only with integers and then another one also with floats. Is there already any implementation in C++/Arduino? If you consider there is a better algorithm to try please let me know. 
 Slightly distractedly I went and connected 5V to the 3.3V pin on my DFRobot Bluno the pins are right next to each other! The magic smoke leaked out of the AMS1117 3.3V regulator in a neat little puff. The sketch that was loaded on the board still runs fine but the Bluno is no longer recognised by my Macbook Pro when I plug it into USB I have tried different ports and different cables; they\re all fineit\s the USB on the Bluno that\s fried. In an attempt to repair it I\ve replaced the AMS1117 check the third paragraph of that tutorialha! with an LF33ABV ; this went well and I\m now getting a stable 3.3V on the
 I am quite new to Arduino and have been trying to build a home automation for my home. I want to know if anyone has used RFM69W with arduino Uno R3 successfully. After browsing through the various websites I came to know that RFM69W for 433MHz is quite reliable RF module and can be used as receiver and transmitter for home applications.It would be great if someone can provide me the link for the examples covering arduno Uno R3 interfacing with RFM69W 433MHz.

 I\m not super-good with my electrical foo. But I\ve managed to get a ULN2803 wired up to give the +12v that my RGB LED strip needs. The strip has four connectors RGB and common +12v. My concern is that I think the Arduino is shorting out- while the Arduino processes my loop the USB connection dies and the RX/TX LEDs light up. Here\s how I am wiring things. I\m currently powering the Arduino through USB so when I say power supply I\m referring to the +12v supply I\m using. power supply ground to Arduino ground ULN2803 pin 9. power supply +12v to 2803 pin 10 common +12v on LED strip. arduino output pin 11 to 2803 pin 1 2803 pin 18 to green LED strip So that\s my circuit. It works- the strip lights up. But again I think it\s wrong. How do I correct it? 
 Im planning on an Arduino project for a restaurant I work at that would require determining how busy it is at any point in time but Im not sure how I would go about procuring this information. I dont have access to any of their IT systems or I would have simply pulled the data from their till systems. I was thinking perhaps measuring the ambient sound of the restaurant as it gets quite loud during peak time but that could be thrown off when the music volume is adjusted. 
 I recently read this post about setting up Eclipse for Arduino. I Build the test project with no erros but when I go to upload my test project it just hangs at 5% with no error messages. If I unplug the arduino-uno it cancels the upload so I know it can see the arduino board. It is just not uploading. Does anyone have any ideas as to what is wrong? I don\t know whats changed but now it doesn\t hang i just get a message after trying to upload: avrdude: stk500_recv: programmer is not responding

 This question might seem stupid but I have been curious about it for a long time. So I am a new engineering student and we learned a lot about designing a controller. For example design controller for a car steering system and so on. All the controllers we designed are in the Laplace domain aka s-domain. And most of the times it will be just a transfer function. So how do real control system engineers use these transfer functions in arduino and other microcontrollers? I mean you cannot just put the function in there right? Do you have to convert the transfer function to some other form and write the code for the microcontroller or is there a simpler way to do it? Thanks for your time!

 I just picked up a new Arduino Micro for a project but the first time I tried to upload to it things went terribly wrong. The USB cable was loose so the power light kept blinking on and off. When I did get it stable I accidentally had \Uno\ selected under \Tools->Board\. I think this was the source of the problem. I\m aware that the solution for these kinds of problems is to try to upload some simple code while in bootloader mode but pressing reset shortly after pressing the Upload button. But this board doesn\t even respond when I press reset. I have tried it with both the on-board button and with an externally button linking RS to ground. Furthermore the board doesn\t show up in my Device Manager not even as an Unknown Device. The device managed doesn\t even refresh when I plug it in. I know the connection is okay because the power light is on. And I know it\s not a driver issue or an issue with the port because I have no trouble getting a different Mic
 I played for the whole day with my Lilypad USB and out of the blue it stopped working. The port in Arduino IDE is gray even when I am running as an admin. The device is no more shown in /dev/ nor in the device manager on Windows. On Windows when I plug the device and push the reset button twice I can see the device under other devices but after a few seconds the device disappears. How can I resolve this matter? Is there another hardware factory reset method? Please help. 
 Do ultrasonic sensors sense through transparent materials? In my case I have to read if theres something inside a transparent acrylic bottle. 
 As far as I know there is still an issue adding / importing custom library to Arduino IDE. Part of the issue is Arduino IDE creates a submenu in libraries menu under heading Contributed. This addition apparently knows that the added / contributed libraries are NOT accessible. If you attempt to Import Library using the Contributed submenu it will add blank line to ino file instead of header file. Never mind that however why is the contributed grayed out and the submenus is not ? I am going to remove all useless contributed libraries references and hopefully the Contributed submenu will go away too. 
 I\m using the arduino uno hooked up to two LEDs. One is in pin 3 and the other one in pin 5. I know that pin 3 is controlled by timer3 and pin 5 by timer 1. I\ve tried a lot of things to have two independent frequencies. I really don\t care about the PWM I have it to 50% constant. There are resources to set the frequency http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/TimerPWMCheatsheet but these are predefined frequencies. I need to have one PWM at 650Hz and the other at 850Hz. Any recommendations on how to approach this problem? 
 I am running out of code and data memory space on ATMega328P. Code size is big as I used several libraries but I only use a few functions of those library. Apparently the default IDE is only doing a partial job in dead code removal remove unreferenced code and data.

Rename loop to o_loop Add void setup{}; void loop{}; Code size is 8 kilo bytes while the program is empty effectively. Start a new program. Add void setup{}; void loop{}; Code size is 0.5 kilo bytes Apparently the IDE linker called by IDE is doing a partial dead code removal job as reducing code from 22kB to 8kB case 1 and 2 instead of 0.5kB case 3.

 My team has a C++ program from another microcontroller that we are moving to Arduino which is currently divided into two main folders the sketch and libraries. We want to be able to open some of the library files in the Arduino IDE along with the sketch something it will do automatically if they are in the same folder but not allow otherwise. The files in question are referenced from the other libraries though which means moving just a few of them results in compilation errors. We dont want to move them all to the sketch folder since that defeats the purpose but a few of my teammates are vehemently opposed to having to edit them using another IDE. So is there a way to have these files open in the Arduino IDE with the sketch? Or do I have to tell my teammates to suck it up and use a second editor if they want to make changes? Alternatively a way to get the libraries able to reference files in the sketch folder would also work. 
 I have problem with WDT reset. After reset the device goes on for a boot loop. from the following link https://code.google.com/p/arduino/issues/detail?id=181 It has been mentioned that there is problem with Bootloader because some of them does not support wdt properly.How can i find which version of bootloader is running in my arduino mega 2560 . Which version of bootloader support wdt properly? where these bootloaders can be found? 
 I\m beginning to to kind of sophisticated things well.. for my entry level skill and I have to control a display with 3 LED and 4/5 types of events and status. I\m using the BlinkWithoutDelay example duplicating all the variables for different status/events but the code is really messy full of puzzling nested if statements. How to simplify the things? Don\t know what to choose because OOP could be a choice but I think it will hurt the low-memory thing inside the Arduino UNO/Leonardo. Interrupts could be another choice but I think they are like threads and following the KISS principle I\d like to stay away from them. So can someone advice me some article/tutorial/code-to-read/whatever to understand how to use a lot of LEDs and keep a lot internal status without screw my brain? EDIT: It is a little bit hard to reproduce a simple skelton of my messy code but it l
 Do I need to re-install many libraries or similar house keeping works? Is the upgrade straight forward? Apparently from Arduino web one need 1.5 BETA series for use with Due. For Pro Mini UNO and ATMega2560 should one use 1.5 BETA or 1.0.6 no beta presumable stable? I am running out of code space. Wonder if the upgrade will install a newer gcc compiler and smaller code size? 
 If switch from Arduino IDE to Atmel studio or Visual Micro how to use existing Arduino library ? Library serves important function of packaging real and complex hardware like NRF24L01 radio board into functions of relatively standard format like radio.init radio.write radio.read radio.on etc. This allows user to easily use the hardware without reading the data sheet. How can the same be achieved under Atmel studio?

 I am trying to read from a quadrature rotary encoder using an Arduino UNO R3. This is done by connecting the encoders channel A pin to the Arduino interrupt 0 pin digital IO pin 2. Inside the interrupt routine I then read the value of channel B connected to digital IO pin 8 to determine the direction of rotation. I am able to read the correct value of channel B using the digitalRead function but when I use bitRead it always gives me a 0. As far as I know digital IO pin 8 is mapped to PORTB bit 0 so I am using bitReadPORTB 0 to read the bit. I also tried to read all of the other pins but all of them show 0 except the LED at pin 13 which shows 0s and 1s when it gets toggled It is also the only pin defined to be an OUTPUT pin whereas the encoder uses INPUT pins. Below is my code: int channelA = 0;int channelB = 8;volatile int rotateNumber = 0;volatile boolean interrupted = false;void setup { Serial.begin115200; attachInterruptcha
 Im new to Arduino and I have two devices that Im trying to control: A RGB LED light strip that can change colors A light sensor that can detect the ambient light level What Id like to do is have the LED strip continuously cycle through a rainbow of colors and the light sensor will adjust the brightness of the LED strip based on the ambient light level.

 I have a project that uses timers and interrupts frequently. A lot of CPU time is spent handling ISRs over an extended period of time. Would this affect code inside the main loop that relies on the millis function since a significant amount of time is spent processing the ISRs? 
 If you have a prototype with arduino and you wish to create a real product can you do it or the fact that it contains the arduino bootloader prevents you? BTW i dont have a product ready. I am thinking options though. Or maybe i will have to go find a job 
 So I bought the Arduino starter kit a few weeks ago and Ive done a few of the projects in the book supplied with the set. Unfortunately the book is quite poor with inaccurate explanations and sometimes no explanation behind what they want you to do in the projects. So Id like to know what people would reccomend? I found 2 well reviewed books; Arduino for Dummies and Arduino Workshop but Im torn which to take. So Im asking in here in hope that I can save time and money on buying and reading a good book from the start. Im a programmer by profession and also know a bit of physics but have little experience with electronics. 
 Im a computer systems engineering student and was planning to buy an Arduino to learn embedded C programming. After researching I found mention that an Arduino may not be a good choice for a beginner that wants to learn about programming embedded systems using C. Im not sure if that is true can an Arduino be programmed in C without using C++ and the other included class libraries? Id prefer to learn how to program things at a fairly low level and not rely on libraries that hide details of the underlying hardware. Can the Arduino be used as a general AVR / microcontroller development platform to learn embedded C programming?

 I dont have much experience with electronics. I was wondering if it is possible to create a push button switch which will turn on the device only if it is tapped twice in quick succession? If it is tapped only once then the device should behave as if nothing happened i.e. tapping the switch again after a specified duration should have no effect. 
 I am a beginner and I want to learn AVR C/CPP. Can I do this using an arduino? Im asking this because I already have one. If so could someone tell me using which IDE can I write code in pure C/CPP and then flash it to the atmega328 on the arduino? Or should I get an AVR and a programmer instead? Ive searched all over the internet and Im really confused by all the terminology. Could someone explain it to me?

The plan is to interface my car with this transparent display to produce a form of HUD.I have done some searching but to no avail so far would appreciate being pointed in the right direction.many thanks 
 I have to track a large amount of data for an Arduino in a program while taking care of a fair amount of other business. I started with a struct like this: struct MyStruct{ // note: these names might as well be foo bar baz uint8_t color; boolean state; uint8_t area; uint8_t number; uint8_t len;}; I have an array of 800 of these. At 5 bytes each thats 4Kb or half the ram on the Arduino Mega. I changed to a struct like this: struct MyStruct{ uint8_t color : 3; // max value 7 // uint8_t state : 1; *** moved thanks Ignacio *** uint8_t area : 5; // m.v. 31 uint8_t number; uint8_t len : 5; // m.v. 31 uint8_t state : 1; // m.v. 1}; I understand this reduces the size of each instance to 3 bytes for a total of 2.4Kb in my array. I have read that in some implementations / chipsets using bit fields in structs can lead to less efficient execution. Obviously this is a more efficient use o
 My sd card initializes fine in the beginnig. It finds the right file and opens it. However after 5 or 6 minutes of data logging the error file not found appears on my lcd. Why would this be the case? I need this to work consistently for atleast an hour this 5 to 6 minutes will not do. Also in my code the sv and cpm data is not yet initialized due to another problem incorporating a sensor. I left these in there and the data is just logged as 0 for those variables. #include &lt;SPI.h&gt;#include &lt;MPL115A1Lib.h&gt; // Pressure Sensor MPL115A1#include &lt;DHT.h&gt; // Temperature and Humidity Sensor RTH03#include &lt;U8glib.h&gt; // LCD Display 128x64#include &lt;floatToString.h&gt; // Converts floats to strings#include &lt;GPS610F.h&gt; // GPS-610F Module#include &lt;RFZuluArduino.h&gt; // Zulu 2km RF Module#include &lt;SD.h&gt; //SD data logger//----- Defining Modules and Variables ------//// Pressure SensorMPL115A1Lib PressSens; // Defines Pressure

 I just have a question regarding Arduino output-pins and Voltage divider because I am getting other results than what my calculations are giving me. I have measured the output-pin from the Arduino at 4.74V according to my caulculations I will have and output voltage of 3.39V with R1 = 4k ohm and R2 = 10k ohm but when I use my multimeter to measure I read a voltage of 0.97V. I have tested with a 9V battery measured to 8.72V. With the same resistors the calculations gives me 6.23V as output when I use my multimeter I can read a output of 6.21 which I consider as ok. So my question is why is my output from the Arduino only 0.97V with the voltage divider? For information: I am using Arduino OSEPP Uno R3 Plus.

 I\m trying to get my arduino GSM shield working with the example Send SMS code provided. However when I upload and compile the program the serial monitor displays SMS Messages Sender and nothing else occurs. Would greatly appreciate it if someone can tell me where I could have gone wrong. EDIT : I\m currently using the Arduino Mega. The shield I\m using is this. I\m following the guide provided by the Arduino\s website with the code part of the example that comes with the Arduino program. Attached is wad is shown on the monitor. I am using both a USB cable and an external power supply. I have performed the jumper wire modification required for the Mega to work with the shield as well.

 I\m trying to report temperature to a server every minute using the CC3000 and Adafruit\s library . It runs between 2-20 hours before the connectTCP call stops working. Should I run through the CC3000 setup again when that happens begin and connectToAP? Which leads to a larger question of how to structure the CC3000 calls to recover from events like internet connection loss wifi router reboot etc. The examples I\ve looked at in the Adafruit library don\t seem to do any recovery from those situations. Update: Added links. I\m starting to think this might be a power issue. I just found a note on the product page recommending a minimum 1A power supply and mine is 650mA. 1A power supply on order. I\ll see if that helps. My <a href=https://github.com/Davepar/thermostat-server/blob/master/arduino/temp_humidity.ino

 I have built a twitter bot with my Arduino and an Ethernet shieldright now the way to make it tweet something is to manually add a phase into the code and upload it to the board for each new tweet I would like to create a simple way of scrolling through a queue of phrases and tweeting each consecutive one after a given amount of time several hours.the issue Im seeing is that the code needs to rerun for each tweet and I cant figure out what needs to be in what loop. Also the entire thing needs to delay for 3.6e^61 hour milliseconds the code takes delays in milliseconds so that I dont spam the feed the twitter for this project is @ether_bot.

 Im using a sketch that helps to reset Da Vinci XYZPrinter cartridge EEPROMs and its based on the NanodeUNIO library. It uses digital pin 7 for data. I want to use my TFT Touch Shield to set the extruder temperature but the shield also makes use for digital pin 7. Being that the sheild is wired to use pin 7 it cant be changed. But any pin that can be used as a digital pin should be useable with NanodeUNIO at least that is my assumption but I cant find where in NanodeUNIO it sets the data pin. Where is that pin set and how can it be changed? 
 I have been trying to count pulses from a 12500hz square wave to trigger an output. Heres the code i have so far. When the arduino is reset it prints 315 to the serial over a 25ms sample. 315 x 40 = 12600. Which seems to me its working perfectly. My only problem is it only returns this number once upon reset of the board. Now if i move that same code down into void loop it counts consecutively giving me inconstant returns. I am not understanding what i need to put in the loop section so i can repeatedly and accurately count how many toggles of the input pin i am getting over a period of time so i can do something to the output based off the presence of the 12500 signal or not. volatile int IRQcount; int pin = 2; int pin_irq = 0; //IRQ that matches to pin 2 void setup { // put your setup code here to run once: Serial.begin 9600; attachInterruptpin_irq IRQcounter RISING; delay25; detachInterruptpin; Serial.print
 Im a complete arduino noob. Are all arduino shields compatible with all arduino boards? Like is the wifi one compatible with the arduino nano &amp; micro as well as the uno etc. Or do I need to be careful when buying shields that theyll be compatible with my board? Also the shields just plug into the boards dont they? 
 I believe I can supply the Arduino with power in three different ways: Use USB. The design trusts the 5V to be regulated and does not regulate it in any way. Use a regulated power source trusted to be 5V and connect it to GND and 5V. Connect an unregulated power source eg a battery to GND and VIN. This should be above 6.2V since the dropout voltage is 1.2V and preferably between 9V and 12V. There is a built-in regulator that will supply the Arduino with exactly 5V. But can I use any of those pins to power other components. E.g. if the Arduino is powered with USB can I use the 5V pin to power a diode? I thought I could but the voltage is 4.70V while the USB is 5.07V. The VIN is 4.26V btw. Are the 5V and VIN only for powering the Arduino? 
 How can I get weight that has been measured by an Arduino device to show up on an iOS mobile or tablet device as a number? Thanks. WarmlyN. 
 For my Arduino project I have a Neopixel RGB Strip with 72 LED\s. I can successfully change the colour of any of the LED\s at the moment I\m only setting the first one 0 for testing purposes so I know my wiring isn\t the problem here it\s my coding. What I would like to do is be able to select a color and then another color and have the first color fade to the next color and so forth much like the LIFX bulbs behave when using the iPhone application. This is what I have at the moment: I am logging output of all the variables to give you an indication of what\s going on. I\m not 100% sure on where I\m going wrong or whether there\s a much easier way to do what I\m after I\m open to suggestions. The function takes a parameter called command which is a string separated by commas: e.g. 255 0 0 RED or 0 255

 Nano is from 2008 and micro from 2012. Micro seems better on every parameter in particular in having a better I think microcontroller ATMega32u4 over ATMega328P. However all the shops I\ve checked out both local and online sell the Nano and only some sell Micro. And Nano is always more expensive than Micro. E.g. at RS-Online 26GBP for Nano link and 16GBP for Micro link . Why do many shops only sell the inferior product? Why is the older and less capable Nano more expensive? Why would anyone buy the Nano over the Micro? 
 I have a Arduino Uno with 14 digital pins. I believe they have an output of 5V.But they can also input values. Im not sure of what exactly it reads when it does that amperage voltage .... Also how do they read it? How can such a tiny thing possibly know what its receiving? Just to provide a little more context to the reading part of this question heres an example circuit. I have a 5V battery connected to an LED and a 220 Ohm resistor. Next thing in the circuit is a wire which exits the main circuit and connects to a digital pin on the Arduino Uno here it reads the value. Then the main circuit closes by connecting to ground. Hope my question is clear enough : 
 I have an Arduino Due and want to save data to an SD card. For this I use a 3.2 \display of ITead with integrated SD slot http://imall.iteadstudio.com/im120419006.html . This I connected to the Arduino. However the Arduino doesnt detect the SD card I\ve tried two different cards and also reformatted both. I wired the three SD ports correctly to the SPI. I wired the CS output on to pin 4 10 or 52 each one once tested without success. I have also tried using ICSP instead of SPI which the Arduino website suggests. Again without success. The test program I used is a test program on the Arduino website for SD cards the program in the end of the post changes marked in bold. Is the problem in the program code or is it a hardware problem? If it is a software problem could you send me a test program that is designed for Arduino Due? I have invested several hours and read tens of forums
 Hey folks I was hoping some of you might cast your eye over my code. It splits up a string read from EEprom into an array of separate strings. Based on String length information stored in a separate array. tempArray[] It reads fine and also seems to process fine ie. it does turn one long string into separate array items for some reason it stops working no the 8th array item?

 I am using the ID12-LA RFID reader with an Arduino Pro Mini 5V 16MHz. I am also using the software serial library to read the serial data form the reader. Initially the serial data is being read properly however after several reads i.e. maybe around 10 - 20 the serial seems to malfunction and calling the read function always returns a 0. Right now the only way I can fix this is if I reset the Arduino. Also note that when I reset the Arduino the RFID reader is staying powered up so its not being reset or anything; this means the issue seems to be from the Arduino. 
 I want to communicate between Arduino Mini Pro china import and a stm32f4 running netmf runtime. At the moment Im able to communicate between SPI1 and SPI2 on the stm32 board. After that I switched on the Arduino. Im using the RF24 library and modified the GettingStarted sample to simply open pipes and send the same byte array again and again to the stm32. It works for the first transmit but after that I did not receive any interrupts on the receiver side. Both NRF24L01+ are power supplied by a breadboard power supply module which supplies 500ma max USB bus. The Arduino is connected and power supplied by a CP2102 USB/Serial adapter. NETMF Address: 0F0F0F0F0FArduino Address: 0F0F0F0F0E As arduino uses little endian I reverse the bytes on stm32 side before writing the address into the pipe. But Im already unsure if I need that step adding the Arduino address on netmf side. Heres my Arduino code: #include &lt;SPI.h&gt;#includ

 Id like to update the sketch of a device that a friend out of state is testing.

 My project involves and RFID reader connected to an Arduino Pro Mini 5V 16MHz and an Adafruit CC3000 breakout WiFi chip. The device reads RFID tags and sends them to my web service. I am using Software Serial to read the RFID device data. After I scan something the Arduino tries to send the value that was read to the web service. This obviously causes a delay and the program only continues execution i.e. next iteration of the loop function after the data has been sent. My problem is simple. While the value is being sent the serial buffer is can still accept scans from the RFID reader and on subsequent iterations because there is data in the buffer the device attempts to send data again. My question is how can I stop the software serial port from receiving data while I am trying to send data to the web service? Then when the data is sent successfully how can I re-enable the software serial port from accepting data?

 I need to emulate a component that measures an input mechanically and varies resistance from 0 to infinity a more detailed set of specs list it at 20-1000ohms though Ill have to actually check its true values myself once I have physical access to it. My aim is to replace this troublesome mechanical component with a current read as available and serviceable component and convert the signal from the new component into an emulated signal varying resistance from the old component. I am not certain as to the resolution required how big the steps can be though it may be able to handle 50ohm leaps just judging by the range of mechanical movement and my past experience with replacing similar mechanical systems with ready-made kits for conversions. Id like to smooth the curve a whole lot more than 50ohm leaps though. I have barely an idea where to begin on this. I thought maybe a resistor ladder and a set of transistors triggered by the arduino to connect

 Im new to Arduino and I am trying a couple of tutorials. What does this line do in a program? while ! Serial; 
 Im developing an active sonar using costas arrays and golomb rulers. I need the arudiono to switch between frequencies very quickly to shorten the length of the ping both to improve processing and to lessen speed of sound limitations. I also need to know the exact times each frequency will be released from the arduino so the real time computer can ignore those frequencies. Im able to generate the melodies I want using the tone command but I couldnt find the time required to change frequencies or the standard deviation of that time. Im also not sure what the minimum legnth of PWM is. So I want to know what is: The switching time for changing PWM frequencies The standard deviation of that switching time The minimum length PWM pulse that can be generated the standard deviation of the length of that minimum PWM pulse. And how might I achieve those minimums? 
 I\m new to Arduino and also new to electronics. I\m following the tutorial here . I\m not understanding the importance of the resistor in this schematic diagram. Can someone please help me on this? 
 I have got some difficulties understanding the memory management. Arduino documentation says it is possible to keep constants like strings or whatever I dont want to change during runtime in program memory. I think of it as embedded somewhere in the code segment which must be fairly possible inside a von-Neumann-architecture. I want to make use from that to make my UI menu on a LCD possible. But Im bewildered by those instructions to just read and print data from program memory: strcpy_Pbuffer char*pgm_read_word&amp;string_table[i]; // Necessary casts and dereferencing just copy. Serial.println buffer ; Why on earth do I have to copy the damn content to RAM before accessing it? And if this is true what happens to all the code then? Is it also loaded to RAM before execution? How is the code 32kiB handled then with only 2kiB RAM? Where are those little goblins carrying floppy disks? And even more interesting: What h
 I am looking for cheap way to have very basic wireless communication between an Arduino and a iphone.I don\t need to send complex data it would be sufficient to trigger the arduino: let\s say it is reading a certain pin voltage and waiting for it to be up in order to do stuff my goal is to trigger this pin up by any wireless and iphone friendly mean. I have figured out two solutions: wi-fi shield cheap RF transceiver. The problem with the latter is that it is not trivial to communicate with a RF transceiver from an iphone. I should add another arduino controlling an RF transceiver on the iphone side and commanding this arduino with an usb. The wi-fi shield on the other hand is too expensive. Even small routers such as the wr703n 30 euro more or less is too expensive in my opinion. I just want to send a bit of information so I don\t want to spend more than 10 euro. The third option would be to hack some cheap wi-fi controlled tool such a lamp or plug: d

 I\m trying to write a simple compiler in C++ for a language that I am making up for my lab. The compiler will have to be able to turn a string like this: do command_one 3 times into a data structure that represents this: &lt;command_one&gt; &lt;command_one&gt; &lt;command_one&gt; it should also be able to turn something more complicated like this: do do c_one do c_two 2 times 2 times c_thr 2 times into a data structure that represents this: &lt;c_one&gt; &lt;c_two&gt; &lt;c_two&gt; &lt;c_one&gt; &lt;c_two&gt; &lt;c_two&gt; &lt;c_thr&gt; &lt;c_one&gt; &lt;c_two&gt; &lt;c_two&gt; &lt;c_one&gt; &lt;c_two&gt; &lt;c_two&gt; &lt;c_thr&gt; Another function will then read the commands out one by one. These examples show all of the functionality that I would want from the compiler. I\m having design issues for the compiler that I want to cre
 We have this controller that we are planning to use with this motor . How do we plug it to the Arduino to make it work? This is a totally new subject for our school team since we are mostly programmers so your help will be really appreciated. 
 Im an amateur and I wish to use timers in my project. Im using an Arduino Mega 2560 with a touch-sensitive screen with six DS18B20 temperature sensors and a DS1307 RTC real time clock. I would like to query my sensors every 1 or 2 minutes to refresh the screen for temperature acquisition. I do not how to program timers to schedule the readings and which timers to use? 
 I am using an external 5 volt power supply to power my Sonar and I am using a Teensy 3.1 to read in analog signal from the sonar. my question is since the teensy is only 3.3v tolerant with analog in is it safe to use with the maxbotix sonar? 
 I bought an ATMega328P-PU and burned OptiBoot onto it using a second Arduino Uno R3 with great success. I then put the microcontroller back on the empty Uno R3 DIP Board for programming connected USB and uploaded the blink sketch successfully. Now to the weird stuff: Blink works on the Arduino Board itself but if I pull it out and stick it into my breadboard the program seems to not start. Here are some facts: happens with or without external crystal 16.000 Pin 9-10 happens with or without the 22pF capacitors from crystal to GND 9-GND 10-GND happens with Fuses set to internal OSC or to external clock Uno default happens with or without the ADC VCC Pin 20 and REFERENCE Pin 21 Pins @ 5V happens on 5V and on 3V3 happens with or without external Pullup on RESET</cod
 Im currently looking at my Arduino MEGA 2560 board and was just wondering why there are different ports to it e.g. ANALOG IN DIGITAL Communication? in fact Ive only seen this in some microcontrollers. Not many microcontrollers have ports dedicated to certain things. Is anyone able to give me an answer as to why there is different ports to the microcontroller? is it making it easier for the chip to handle etc. A detailed but not too detailed answer would be great! 
 I think about building my own robotic mower therefore I would like to detect if the surface the mower in moving on is grass pavement gravel ... etc. Which sensors would be the best choice in order to achieve this? The benefits: no parimeter wire to bury possible lawn edge detection here most mowers fail to do a good job

 I am an arduino enthusiast and i am new to it.just wanted to know weather the micro processor itself could create a file in its memory while its is running. I know that it is possible to read a write from a file in c++ but is it possible to do so in an arduino while its running.

 I have an Arduino Mega2560 configured to Hiduino which makes the Arduino a driverless class-compliant MIDI interface. I am currently converting RS232 serial I/O data to midi data using the hairless midi-serial software running in the background. I am hoping that I can utilize this Hiduino interfacing to send and receive this data in the same fashion just through the Arduino instead. I am lead to believe this would require the MIDI library to be used to program the 2560 to understand the serial bytes coming from the controller and converting to the appropriate midi bytes into my program and vice versa. I am just getting into programming. Could someone could give an example of how a program could be written to send and receive this data through the Arduino? 
 I had my arduino uno connected to an external 12V supply for 2-3 hours as I was working on other parts of my project. Suddenly the voltage from pin 9 which I was monitoring in the oscillator dropped down to 0 approximately. I went on removing the external supply. The board was very very hot. I then connected the usb to my laptop and I got an error 43 windows did not allow the device to connect because it was reporting problems. I cant load any program of course. The 5V pin works but it outputs a voltage lower than usualat about 3.9V.When I connect the external supply the 5V pin outputs full voltage. Any idea? Any fix? 
 I have a header file where I try to collect global variable declarations. When trying to typedef a map I get the following error: n file included from Dis0_10.ino:7:/var/folders/jl/nv1qvh6n569cxq9xxfd6dx980000gn/T/build8295701509021940161.tmp/globals.h:23: error: expected initializer before \&lt;\ token relevant code snippets from global.h are: #ifndef GLOBALS#define GLOBALS#include &lt;map&gt; ... typedef std::map&lt;uint8_tuint8_t&gt; memmap_t; I have no clue why this statement should fail. I consider it rather straight forward. So I think there must be some problems of this kind here . Or am I missing another include?

 I have to realize a communication between Arduino Leonardo and a demon which runs on a pc. The demon has to tell Arduino informations about the operative system of the machine to which it is linkedthe dimension of the screen and other things about its state. As it has to work both on Windows and on MAC Os I thought to write the demon in Java but ive seen that the library RXTX for communication is hardware dependent so it can create problems if I use a different machine. In your opinion shall I use Processing or there is another way to achieve that? Thank you in advance. 
 I understand that el wire and paper needs a special power source known as an inverter to light it up. If I wanted to control it from an arduino what point would I connect the arduino to the light or inverter?

 How can you sense a closed circuit? I want to have 4 pins with disconnected wires and when touched with a fifth wire play a specific note on a piezo buzzer until disconnected again. This project loops through several keys and checks whether they are being touched using the Capactive Sensor library . I want to do something similar but not with capacitive sensing. Alternatively it may work to have the buzzer always trying to play a note but only sounds when one of the 4 circuits is close. I\m just not sure how that would work in the code. Here is their code that uses capactive sensing: #include &lt;CapacitiveSensor.h&gt;#include pitches.h#define COMMON_PIN 2 // The common \send\ pin for all keys#define BUZZER_PIN A4 // The output pin
 down vote favorite Im using Arduino YUN. I need to use the serial port on both sides linux and arduino.

I cant see what the arduino program or serial baud rate has anything to do with the linux side of YUN booti
 I\m working on this project where I have interfaced a LED strip a two wire LED strip with this Arduino its not an Uno. I have setup every thing correctly according to this instructable. I\m able to make a simple blinky pattern and I turn it on/off with an Android app I made to communicate with the Arduino using Bluetooth on my phone. Cool. What I cannot understand is since the strip is two wired how should I address individual LEDs on the strip to make more complex patterns? Can I use bit shifts? Reading an article from Makezine insufficient reps to post more than 2 links it says that I should connect the strup directly to the output pin. IMO this will fry the Arduino or in a less virulent sway not light up the strip in any way. 
 I have two Arduinos on a RS-485 line one acting as a Master and the other as a Slave. The Master simply transmits information to the Slave which parses it. They work fine when the Master is turned on first and then the Slave is turned on. However I\d like to make it so that the Slave can be disconnected and reconnected to the line and re-discover the connection ideally without resetting either Arduino. Here\s the code from the Slave\s loop void loop { if RS485Serial.available &gt;0 //Look for data from other Arduino { char byteSend = RS485Serial.read; // Read received byte String str = StringbyteSend; if str == &lt; { // beginning of the transmission // does stuff here } } } Here is the relevant section of Master\s loop: output_value =&lt;1111111&gt;; RS485Serial.printoutput_value; delay250; RS485Serial.flush;</code
 Is there a way to connect and read the output of a long stem thermometer like this one to an Arduino? 
 I am successful putting and retrieving char array into Arduino flash memory using PROGMEM char arrays. I am building my app using header files with class definition / implementation and would like to keep the strings in same header file. If I define another PROGMEM char array neither one can be executed. In other words - these PROGMEM are global arrays as far as Arduino compiler is concerned they compile but wont show up. Here is my test code lcd.clear; lcd.print*strFlashDebug[0]; // in CDebug lcd.setCursor01; lcd.print*strFlashTrack[0]; // in CTrack If I put both definitions in same header file it only works with only one lcd.print enabled not commented out. It appears that multiple PROGMEM arrays can be defined and compiled but only one is actually usable. Any comments are appreciated.Cheers Vaclav 
 I bought a cheap Make kit at Radioshack which includes some sort of proprietary Arduino-Uno capatible motor/sensor shield. Naturally the documentation is pretty bad. I found a circuit schematic 2770168-CorePCB_schematic.pdf but I\m still having trouble mapping the pins to the Arduino\s pins. Can anyone help me make sense of this? What I\ve made out so far is the shield\s screw terminals appear to be connected to quadruple h-bridges. However there are several other pin headers that I can\t quite make out. I think it also directly exposes 4 of the Uno\s ADC pins and 4 DIO pins. There are four pins for dual IR line sensors but there\s a lot of circuitry between these an any Arduino pins. Almost everything feeds into a DC6688F2SCN chip but I can\t find a datasheet anywhere so I have no idea what it does. The manual says jumpers on J16 ne
 I tried in my Arduino the negative logic to get a digital input from a switch with 10 K resistance. If I want to use the positive logic what kind of resitance I have to use? For me seems that 10KOhm it to big and probably a smaller resistor should be used. How do we compute the value of the resistor? The schemes of Negative and Positive Logic from Valvano\s notes/ebook - University of Texas gives 10 k in both cases. Is it correct? 
 I am using 3 Arduino UNO with a Ethernet shield each one is connected to my Home Internet Switch with a Ethernet Cable. Each Arduino UNO is collecting temperature/humidity for each bedroom in my house. The data is sent to a MySQL Database using PHP/HTML. I assigned a different Local IP address to each Arduino and a different MAC Address. They are work fine for a while 5 minutes and then they conflict each other.If I use one Arduino at a time it works fine but I can get them to work together. Any idea how to solve the problem? 
 I am used to arduino sketches with a void setup part that runs once and a void loop part that keeps looping. What happens when you have void functions outside of the main void loop ? Will these all keep looping in parralel or do they run one after the other? Or do certain void functions only run once certain criteria has been met like a while loop? For example in the code below when will the void receiveDataint byteCount and the void sendData functions run? //I2C_test//This code demonstrates communication via an I2C bus between a raspberry pi and an arduino.//When the Raspberry pi master sends data to the Arduino slave the Arduino uses this//data to control a motor. After the Arduino has recieved data from the master it then collects//data from the external environment via a sensor and sends this data back to the Raspberry pi.#include &lt;Wire.h&gt;int number = 0;
 Id like to extract data collected by a battery powered arduino for example once a day without stopping it and not using SD card. Its posible when I want to extract the collected data to connect a laptop through the USB and then get data because Arduino is at regulat time intervals calling Serial.println...? 
 The title sums it all up. While testing the new proximity detector I bought off of Amazon a spark flew from some random area and my Arduinos On LED went off while its Loop LED stayed in a dim state. I am here to ask you guys if this basically counts my Arduino as fried and that I need a new one or if I should wait and see if it works again being that I wrote this 5 minutes after the thing happened.

 Is there any central place that we can get drawing pattern functions for the addressable LED strips like the once based on the WS2812B component? These are sold on the Adafruit site under the NeoPixel name. For example I know of a few pattern examples like the Larson Scanner Cylon a candle light flicker or a rainbow pattern. However I could not find a single pattern repository. I am working on a project for kids learning to program the Arduino and it would be nice to have all the patterns in a single place and to be able to switch between the program examples with a mode switch. If people send me links I am happy to post a blog of them.

 Im trying to use CTC mode on Arduino 1 but I have the following problem.I need to generate an interrupt on threshold B and A and I have set the prescaler to 1 since I want to generate interrupt A at 15999 correspond to 1ms and interupt B at 15 ie a number small enough from the start of counting.Ihave write a println function in ISRA and B to proof the calling of the latter but the program does not print all the characters in the println function and furthermore the counter does not reset at treshold A but stop his work.How I can resolve the problem?

 I have programmed my MEGA2560 to Hiduino firmware in an effort to fabricate an RS-232 &lt;> Midi converter instead of using Hairless MIDI&lt;>Serial running in the background to use my fader controllers with Pro Tools. In order for my audio program to send and receive midi data properly it needs to sync up to my controllers via a ping. Pro Tools sends midi message \90 00 00\ and expects message \90 00 7F\ sent back from the Arduino. Right now Pro Tools is sending the ping to the Arduino I can see that happening on the Rx LED. So I am having trouble understanding the appropriate way to receive that specific message 90 00 00 and send back 90 00 7F out from the Arduino. I have been looking at the Callback function to do this but not sure how to read the specific incoming message and sending out a specific message using this function. How would I configure the below code to properly make this happen? #include &lt;MIDI.h&gt;MIDI_CREATE_DEFAULT_INSTANCE;//
 Im working on a custom Arduino core based on the teensy code and want to be able to get the board USB VID/PID from boards.txt as in .board.vid and .board.pid From what I can tell Arduino already does this for the Leonardo and similar since if I change the VID/PID in boards.txt then the sketch will run with those values. But how do I actually get at them? Right now the code I have has hard coded values but it would be great to make them dynamic.

 I just acquired a Arduino learning kit which includes a 20x4 LCD display. I was going to test it so I grabbed an example hello world program from the Arduino docs connected the display appropriately and then Voila! ... Oh it didn\t work.. The display lights up both its backlight and characters however not in any desirable pattern. The first and third lines are full white display is white-on-blue while lines 2 and 4 are full blue. See picture: The below schematic is exactly how I\ve connected the display which should be correct. I triple-checked all wiring for any shorts adjusted the potentiometer to a good value and quadruple-checked the connections and wasn\t able to find any errors. The dead-simple example program is following: #include &lt;LiquidCrystal.h&gt;// LiquidCryst

 Im trying to find a way to set a -D compiler option from within the boards.txt file. Basically set a #define for use in code. There are already some special ones like board.vid but is there a generic way to do it? Somehow the Teensy add-on adds a little magic that allows the IDE to recognize options like:.board.define0=-DHELLOWORLD.board.option0=-DHELLOWORLD In other words add the -DHELLOWORD #define HELLOWORLD to the command line for GCC. BUT I cant get this to work without the Teensy add-on installed. Is there a way to do this with the stock IDE? 
 The amount of memory needed for my user interface is outrageous. Hence I decided to use flash memory. But after some successful readouts from program space problems emerge. Updated: I have some sort of initialisation files to collect all global arrays which go into flash like this: intitialisation.cpp #ifndef INITIALISATIONDEF#define INITIALISATIONDEF#include initialisation.h //which includes Arduino libraries and globals.hconst uint8_t gl_PsNMenuType[MAXMENUS] PROGMEM = { 0 0 0 0 0}; // this is what I intend to read out later. const uint8_t gl_PsNMenuParent[MAXMENUS] PROGMEM = { MAXMENUS 0 0 0 0}; const uint8_t gl_PsNMenuFixTexts[MAXMENUS][MAXFIXTEXTSPM] PROGMEM = { { 20 2 MFTS MFTS MFTS} // 0 {2 9 1 MFTS MFTS} // 1 {2 10 MFTS MFTS} //2 {2 11 MFTS} //3 {2 12 MFTS} //4};#endif Updated: while I propagate all global vars via another header globals.h: #ifndef
 Please dont judge me for asking this question i have never touch arduino before but We plan to use it in our thesis we are doing a budget plan and it must include wires. can anyone tell me the common wire sizes used? This is to estimate the prices. 
 What\s the best way to wire a QRB1114 IR sensor to an Arduino Uno? I\m attempting to use it as a white-line-on-black-background line detector. Google shows many different ways wire it to an Arduino but I\m using this one because of its simplicity. However when I tested the circuit using the AnalogInput example code I\m not getting the expected behavior. It registers a reading of 0 for both white and black backgrounds I\m using white and black electrical tape as test surfaces and occasionally registers between 5-10 if there\s nothing in front of it at all. What is the most likely problem? Is this circuit an improper way of wiring the sensor? Is my sensor defective? Is the code not reading it properly? This is my test code: #define BUTTON_PIN 2#define LED_PIN 13const int IR_SENSOR_PIN = A
 I have ATmega168a on a breadboard. I am programming it via the Arduino IDE and a FT232RL USB adapter. When I select my board for 168 and upload I get the following error: stk500_getsync: not in sync: resp=0x00 Normally this error means that either: My wiring is not correct I choose the wrong board So to double check my wiring I replace the 168 with a 328p. I am able to program the 328 so I think its the board selection. I have tried Ardiono Diecimila or Duemilanove w/ ATmega168 and I also have a custom board entry: atmega168bb.name=ATmega168 breadboard 16 MHz internal clockatmega168bb.upload.protocol=stk500atmega168bb.upload.maximum_size=14336atmega168bb.upload.speed=57600atmega168bb.bootloader.low_fuses=0x62atmega168bb.bootloader.high_fuses=0xDFatmega168bb.bootloader.extended_fuses=0xF9atmega168bb.bootloader.path=arduino:atmegaatmega168bb.bootloader.file=ATmegaBOOT_168_atmega328_pro_
 I have a ATmega328p chip from a kit that was supposed to be an Arduino compatible thing. I decided to go beyond Arduino and try to program the chip directly. I setup an UNO as an Arduino ISP more or less like the image here but added some LEDs to pins 8 9 and 10 for feedback. This image has this caption. Because no external clock source is connected the ATmega must be configured to use its internal clock. I think this chip was flashed with whatever tells it to use an external oscillator. And I do not have an external oscillator. So how can I tell the chip to again use an internal oscillator when using an UNO as my programmer? avrdude -p m328p -c avrisp -b 19200 -P /dev/cu.usbmodem1d11121avrdude: AVR device initialized and ready to accept instructionsReading | ################################################## | 100% 0.05savrdude: Device signat

 Can anyone recommend an Arduino-based asynchronous scheduling library for controlling a small mobile robot? I\m writing the control code for a small 2-wheeled Arduino-Uno based robot. It has a few bumper sensors IR sensors and ultrasonic sensors. I\ve written an initial pass from scratch using loop to read sensors and set motor values appropriately and then wait for the motor to have effect but I\m finding this cluggy. Some of the sensors like the ultrasonic range finders require a small delay to operate and the motors require a delay to have an effect. Blocking loop is the simplest way to achieve this but it wastes cycles and can be difficult to time each action properly without throwing off other behaviors. Writing an asynchronous scheduler would be more efficient but a lot more complicated and I expect I would be reinventing the wheel. I found this lis

 curious if a Arduino could be configured to read and serial print raw binary bits from a proprietary serial encoder used on machine tools and robots... if so might have a lot of other possible uses. I made up a 120 volt servo drive for manually moving big fanuc machine/robot servos handy during rebuilding/service to be able to move a axis without a control...but the older drives read 4 gray code channels kinda like a set of halls for brushless commutation...on the serial versions same drive could move the motor if I could decipher the commutation bits and output graycode to the drive... a tiny Arduino looks like a ideal little thing to try doing this. Scoped out the signals long ago kinda know where the bits are but need to be able to actually print them out thru 90 degrees of shaft rotation to find the 12 steps for commutation required by the drive. Arduino is new to me but in the past few days have been quite impressed with its abilities. If anyone can sugg

 I\m asking if how can I implement this one. I\m aware about multiple devices being connected over SPI like having to select individual SS pin for each. Adafruit\s CC3000 works fine alone along with the default Adafruit library. CC3000 uses SPI. MFRC522 RFID module by sonmicro bought at Sparksfun uses SPI too. It works fine too independently. But whenever I connect them together only WiFi works perfectly. I dont want to turn on and off the wifi to make way for the RFID to communicate since it takes some time for it to be connected in a wireless network.

 On my Arduino Yun openwrt-yun updated to latest version I have a bluetooth dongle in the usb port; I have installed bluez-libs and bluez-utils and python-bluez.

There does not seem to be any utility installed to pair with a device nor can I figure out how to get pairing to work by editing config files. I can find the device with hciconfig and hcitool but rfcomm cant connect without the pin. If I try the same sequence on my Linux laptop after pairing with the gui rfcomm is able to connect so I know the device is working properly JY-MCU HC-06 on another Arduino.

 So I made a program that controls two LEDs when two buttons are pressed but one of the LEDs comes on when the button isnt pressed. And whats weird is that if I literally move around the breadboard the LED might turn off for a little and if hold the button down while doing it the LED remains solid. I have done a lot of taking out and switching wires without any unexpected effects. However if I switch the LED wires the other LED turns and stays on while the first one turns off so I am pretty sure that it is a programming error. Here is my code: const int ledPin1 = 8;const int buttonPin1 = 1;const int ledPin2 = 9;const int buttonPin2 = 2;int buttonState1 = 0;int buttonState2 = 0;void setup { pinModeledPin1 OUTPUT; pinModebuttonPin1 INPUT; pinModeledPin2 OUTPUT; pinModebuttonPin2 INPUT;}void loop {buttonState1 = digitalReadbuttonPin1;buttonState2 = digitalReadbuttonPin2; if buttonState1 == LOW { digitalWriteledPin1 HIGH; } else

Moreover I would like to control the flight from within the ArduPilot from the data that I get from Pixy. Pixy has libraries that will give me well formatted data for the object detection For Arduino development.

I have managed to get the shield to play the audio from an analog pin by feeding it a WAV file header followed by data from analogRead . I get audio and it\s clearly modulated by the mic. But it sounds very garbled and has loads of noise. It sounds like a poorly tuned AM radio. If I disconnect the mic from the analog pin I get very low static if I connect a wire with nothing on the other end I get loud noise. And with the mic I get somewhat modulated noise. I\m fairly sure this means I\m getting magnetic/electrical interference somehow. If I do pinModepin INPUT_PULLUP; it seems to reduce the noise when the mic isn\t plugged in - but when it is there is even more noise. Though it\s less random. I have tried analogReference
 I want to modify the Arduino library files to make my Micro ATMega32u4 only a composite CDC / MSC USB device. From what I can tell the library already can make a composite CDC / HID device if I #define both CDC_ENABLED and HID_ENABLED and change u8 _cdcComposite = 0; to u8 _cdcComposite = 1; in USBCore.cpp. In some of the files such as USBAPI.h and USBCore.h there are a few references to MSC device classes but no implementation. So some questions: What USB stack code is the Arduino Usb code based off? Has anyone modified the Arduino library code to support MSC? What general changes would be required to the USB code?

 Im really at my wits end. For a couple of hours I have been programming a custom board that uses everything as on the Arduino Leonardo. A few hours ago I am not able to upload anymore. I get the following error: avrdude: error: buffered memory access not supported. Maybe it isnt a butterfly/AVR109 but a AVR910 device? Ive tried everything from re-installing the IDE re-installing the board in Device Manager changing the COM Port. I really just dont know anymore.

 I have Arduino board with SIM900A GSM Modem setup. My requirement is to connect to a server and send / receive information. My server would be placed in some remote place and would probably not be in a network. It would have LAMP setup Linux Apache MySQL and Python. I mean its just a standalone server and one cannot access it via Internet. However it would have an IP of its own. So is it that using this GSM Modem at Arduino side only I can connect to my server OR do I need a GSM Modem setup my web server side also - if in case I need it at my web server site then what AT commands set I need to follow. Is there any extra other setup I need to make. 
 I have a sketch that works just fine on my Arduino Uno board but somehow mess up when I try to retrieve data from a Nano Board. I have wired a TCS230 color sensor to get data about some colours. I get the right data using the Uno Board but not from the Nano. Im not that experienced using Nano so maybe theres some fundamental differences Im not aware of? This is the code I use: #include &lt;TimerOne.h&gt;#define S0 6#define S1 5#define S2 4#define S3 3#define OUT 2int g_count = 0; // count the frequecyint g_array[3]; // store the RGB valueint g_flag = 0; // filter of RGB queuefloat g_SF[3]; // save the RGB Scale factor// Init TSC230 and setting Frequency.void TSC_Init{ pinModeS0 OUTPUT; pinModeS1 OUTPUT; pinModeS2 OUTPUT; pinModeS3 OUTPUT; pinModeOUT INPUT; digitalWriteS0 LOW; // OUTPUT FREQUENCY SCALING 2% digitalWriteS1 HIGH; }// Select the filter color void TSC_FilterCo
 I have a broken SGSII phone screen is broken everything else should be in good condition so I wanted to know if I can somehow use this hardware for any project in conjunction with my Arduino or BeagleBoneBlack. If thats the case where should I start? any tutorials books articles etc? The screen is broken so I was thinking about using the gps camera or processor not sure if there is some sort of API anything that let me use the hardware because the chances of repairing are not in the plans... 
 Consider the following minimal example where I set pinMode before calling SPI functions: #include &lt;SPI.h&gt;void setup{ pinMode10 OUTPUT; SPI.begin10; SPI.setDataMode10SPI_MODE1;} void loop{ delay1000; SPI.transfer101;} Now always when SPI.transfer101 is called in the loop I see that the slave selected pin goes down to 1.65V but not 0 as it shoudl! see image below If we don\t call pinMode like this: #include &lt;SPI.h&gt;void setup{ SPI.begin10; SPI.setDataMode10SPI_MODE1;} void loop{ delay1000; SPI.transfer101;} we get what we would expect when calling SPI.transfer: Is that a bug or do you have an explanation for that behaviour? Thank you very much in adv
 I heard that Servo library cannot send and receive from other arduinos without inturrupting the timer and messing up the motors. SoftwareServo is supposedly the answer to this. Is this true? Neither libraries are working for this problem at the moment. 
 I\d like to know the differences between this two boards: Arduino Pro Mini and Arduino Pro Micro . Even if I\ve read this and this related post it is not clear enough. I\ve always used the Arduino UNO or Leonardo and I\m a little bit scared from using those compact miniaturised boards. I have seen so far those differences:- The Micro dont need the separate FTDI while the Mini does- The Micro takes more time to bootup due to usb device keyboard/mouse emulation is more like a Leonardo then a Uno- They both have 5V and 3.3V versions- The Mini has 2 more Digital IO and 2 more Analog Inputs 1 more PWM- The pinout is the same a
 I have an Arduino board with a sensor an OLED screen and an XBee module. Ive setup the timer interrupts in timer1 to sample the sensor every one second.

 The ADS1256 chip is a high precision 24bit 8 channel analog digital converter based on SPI communication that is suitable for biomedical applications and perfect for sensing ECG and EEG signals. I want to hook it up to an arduino e.g. an arduino mega or an arduino due. Similar ADCs from analog devices are: ADS1248 ADS1251 ADS1252 ADS1252U ADS1253 ADS1255 ADS1259 ADS1278 ADS1298 ADS1299 etc. Its nice that there are [tiny coin sized breakout boards] available for the ADS1256 that include basic components like an 8mhz quartz crystal and cost only around 25 USD. Several people have in the past struggled to get ADC readings using Arduino. Working only with the data sheet it took them several days or even weeks.

 I connected my Arduino Uno to my raspberry via USB serial. Im able to read out both digital and analog pins of my Arduino using the Python nanpy library v.0.8.However I cant find support for the pulseIn function. It seems nanpy doesnt support pulseIn at all.

I have successfully tried the blink an led and fade an led sketches so the compiling and uploading are ok I am using a desktop computer with Linux Fedora 20. Now I want to go on to use the cell phone network to communicate with my mobile \phone. However I am puzzled by something I assume everybody else understands already and that is the references to select either software serial port or hardware serial port to be connected to GPRS Shield. Please could someone explain what software or hardware serial port is in simple terms or point me to a web site that does so? Do I need any wired connection with my PC other than the USB link I use for uploading sketches? Note: I bought a discounted GPRS shield labelled version 1.0a2.

 So I am trying to test what will eventually be a Arduino controlling 3 110V motors that are currently controlled by an analog pot. But more on that later. I am trying to test out using a digital pot never have before and am running into some issues with tutorials I have found online. For now I want to control a LED with the digital pot Spec Sheet so that the LED fades in and fades out in a continuos loop. Here is the tutorial I followed . It uses a different chip model but it seems from the pot I am using that the pins are the same. I could be wrong? I double and triple checked the wiring and it matches below. Here is the code I am running slightly modified f

Can anybody see the changes I\d need to make that would make the GoL code at that link work like this te
 Would it be possible to have an Arduino write directly to a MySQL database? Im a web programmer so Im familiar with how to get records from a MySQL database. I have MAMP installed on my mac so I have the ability to build an interface directly in the web browser that retrives the records from a MySQL database. What Im thinking is to connect the Arduino directly to my computer via USB and write data from the sensors or the pins directly to my MySQL database. Im using two phototransistor to record whenever something blocks the light. Each sensor records individually a timestamp for when the blocking occur. Is that possible?

 I\ve been trying to get an Arduino I have a Mega and Uno lying around to read values from a small array of 3 ColorPal 20380 which individually work as intended with some reflective material. The demo gives no problem but I am confused as to how to approach activating all the 3 sensors and reading the 3 different sets of values so that I can analyze them in a program on the Arduino. How can I get all three sensors to output data to my program in parallel? I want to use the values at the same point in time on all three sensors to do some calculations in my program. Should I approach something like a state machine? Or at least near-parallel a few ms delay is fine too? How would an example look like? The most confusing thing for me is the non-inverted open-drain protocol it uses. From the documentation: <b
 Basic question: How far do I have to go to assure that integer math is done correctly? For example this is probably overdone: unsigned long burnTime = 0UL;unsigned long curBurnTime = 0UL;// Do some stuff that sets the above variables to millis at various times// Later on...unsigned long adjustedBurnTime = unsigned long burnTime + curBurnTime / 1000UL; Would the math be done correctly if I went to a more minimal last statement since all the elements of the equation are unsigned longs? Like this: unsigned long adjustedBurnTime = burnTime + curBurnTime / 1000UL; Or even: unsigned long adjustedBurnTime = burnTime + curBurnTime / 1000; 
 I am creating a tiny game on my Arduino UNO with an Adafruit ST7735 1.8 TFT / SD breakout. I am performing screen operations using the built-in TFT-library. The problem is screen flickering. Even though I take care to prepare data and minimize the time between clearing the screen and writing the new stuff to it the screen refresh is significant. I heard someone mention a something called double buffering so I read a bit up on it but I am frankly clueless on how to implement it on an Arduino UNO. Is it possible to implement double buffering on an Arduino UNO to prevent screen flickering and if so how? Libraries used: #include &lt;TFT.h&gt;#include &lt;Wire.h&gt;#include &lt;SPI.h&gt;#include &lt;SD.h&gt; The screen is cleared like this: screen.background000; // Clear itscreen.textbuf 10 25; // Write new stuff 
 I have to store sampled data of a low frequency SineWave of 250Hz into a SDcard via the Arduino WiFi Shield. Note that I am relatively new to the Arduino world. Detailed Requirement Specs: 1 Sampling Frequency = ~8kHz rate of which ADC samples data 2 Byte Size of single sample = 10 bits adc = 1.25bytes 3 SDcard = Micro SanDisk card 32GB. I did do a lot of research on this and I know that SDcard writing latency is about ~250ms for SDHC. I dont think I will be able to comprehend advance technique such as changing the kernel. All i need to do is to sample this 250Hz or less analog wave and to be stored in the SD card. Also can the Arduino ADCs sampling rate be reduced below 8kHz? Would using sdfatlib do the job or is it still not sufficient? Any help would be awesome. THANK YOU.

 I have a water flow sensor with Arduino Megs 2560 board. I am trying to conceptualize the concept to calculate amount of water getting dispensed esp. in 1234 and 5 liters quantity. Water flow sensor specification: http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/images/b/b7/Water_flow_sensor_datasheet.pdf I would connect the sensor input to any pin from 22-53 pin. Suppose I connect to ping 23 so in my setup function I would add: attachInterrupt23 pulseCounter FALLING; where pulseCounter is an interrupt function triggered on each signal generated from sensor and increments a variable void pulseCounter{ // Increment the pulse counter pulseCount++;} Now how do I calculate the flowrate and water dispensed in milliliters using this information? How do I know the freqz of the MCU which is required as water

 I want to use a proto shield brand is unimportant and solder some components to it to make something more premanent than using a breadboard. My question is can the components be soldered directly to the middle area where there are a lot of small holes? I would assume this is possible but everywhere I look people add mini breadboards to their proto shields. If its possible then I assume components and wires cant just be connected in a row like on a breadboard and would instead need some solder between 2 holes where for example a component and seperate wire are connected? 
 I am trying to run a test of the speed of an Arduino and how it\s affected by different temperatures.

 How can we increase the Arduinos ADC sampling rate to 1 MHz while maintaining a 10 bit resolution? Can we change the prescaler to 16 to get 1 MHz ADC clock? If not what alternatives are there? Another Atmel chip that works with the Arduino library? Or any external ADC?

 I have a simple sketch running on a BE Leonardo-compatible board. It reads input from a potentiometer and outputs to two RGB LEDs which change colour over time - in a different pattern if certain inputs are received. Other than that the only code is serial I/O for debug purposes. Its disabled using a #define in the running version to prevent serial buffer overflow when not connected. When the board is powered by USB everything works. When the board is powered by 9V battery after about 4 minutes it hangs - the LEDs go off and the L13 light on the board starts glowing at varying strength. There is nothing connected to pin 13. Even the reset button doesnt work. If the board is then connected to the computers USB port after a few seconds the hang clears and the program resumes. Can anyone offer a possible explanation for and solution to this fault? 
 I am trying to write one code that takes data from serial ie. 0x4E 0x20 0x-- 0x0D . 0x-- may be any hex in -- The user will input these hex one by one and raspi will take all of them in buffer.Whenever 1st 2nd and 4th data is matched the 3rd one will be printed in serial ie. Serial.print3rd; //Decimal valueelse Serial.print // may be 00 I was trying with this code: byte buffer[4];int cnt = 0;void setup{ Serial.begin9600; Serial.printlnStart;}void loopvoid{ // read max 12 bytes if cnt &lt;= 4 &amp;&amp; Serial.available buffer[cnt++] = Serial.read; if cnt == 4 // all bytes read... { // assume the arrays are the same boolean same = true; // the ans array holds the right answer byte ans[]={0x4E0x200x010x0D}; for int i=0; i&lt;= 4 &amp;&amp; same; i++ same = buffer[i] == ans[i]; if same { Serial.pri
 Im using an Atmega168 in a project that involve using the ISRs from multiple sources. I have an ISR hooked up to an external button and a timer to use it as a reset button after a predetermined hold time. Im also using an ISR hooked upto UART. The UART is connected to an external Linux based SoC. Upon receiving specific commands from the linux machine the atmel will perform certain functions. In very rare occasions the linux hangs up during tranmission and is always sending out the UART commands. This saturates the ISR and it also prevents the reset button ISR to function. Although this happens rarely I would like to take measures for this. As far as I know there are no way to set priority in avr ISRs. So what can I do if the UART ISR is always called and prevents the rest of the board from functioning? EDIT:I think the problem arises when the linux machine sends an empty string to the atmel.the UART_receive on the atmel gets stuck at: while
 I just began following the projects in the Arduino Projects Book included in the Arduino Starter Kit. While using LEDs as in the first few examples of the book I am having a difficult time keeping them in contact with the breadboard. I can usually move the LED around until it turns on but even a push of a button can make it lose contact with the board. I havent used much more than switches jumpers LEDs and resistors so I dont know if any of the other components behave the same. For the more complex projects it seems like it would be hard to tell if you have it setup properly if you cant be sure the components are making a connection with the breadboard. Is there a particular way to get all the components to sit nicely in the breadboard or to modify them to do so? 
 I am trying to learn how to make a shift register work. I have been working off of the Arduino ShiftOut tutorial . My issue is that the shift register isn\t working when the circuit is powered and I am not sure what is wrong. I suspect the issue is with pins 10-13 on the 74HC595? I have done this with an actual board and the 123d.circuits.io simulator with the same result: http://123d.circuits.io/circuits/444111-shift-register The code is very simple and taken from the tutorial : // SH_CP; 11const int clockPin = 9;// DS; 15const int dataPin = 8;// ST_CP; 12const int latchPin = 10;void setup { pinModeclockPin OUTPUT; pinModedataPin OUTP
 I dont know what wires to get for my first Arduino project. I am planning on getting a pre-made light strip that I would control with an Arduino from across my room. Is there any specific type of wire to get? It needs to be about 15 feet. There are so many choices but I dont know what I need. Does anyone else know? 
 I am manipulating the code from ElectroSmash\s pedalSHIELD to my needs. Instead of using the programming switch indicated in his code. I want to use individual footswitches to control what effect I want. For example: If the clean switch is hit the clean effect code will run through lighting that corresponding LED. If the distortion switch is hit the clean effect will go off along with its LED. The distortion effect code will then run through and light that corresponding LED. and so on. For book keeping lets denote the following:clean switch => clean_switchdistortion switch => distortion_switchdelay switch => delay_switch Here is my code so far: int in_ADC0 in_ADC1; int POT0 POT1 POT2 out_DAC0 out_DAC1; int FOOTSWITCH = 7; //declarations used throughoutint upper_threshold lower_threshold;//declarations for distortion#define MAX_DELAY 20000uint16_t sDelayBuffer0[MAX_DELAY]; //typedef unsingned int for A0uint16_t s
 I would like to kindly request if this kind of project is possible using Arduino motherboard. If yes what would be the tools to use. Thanks in advance. 
 Im working on a small project for a presentation. My goal is to read the UID of multiple Mifare Classic cards and compare it to a hardcoded list for different actions. All is well the reading and comparing part that is but 2 small problems that I have encountered are: The first maybe up to three since the reader is a little bit on the fast side read after uploading my code will return a UID of just 0s and a wrong PICC type. After reading a PICC and then trying to read another the reader prints the UID / PICC Type of the reader before which is kinda not helpful when trying to light LEDs based on UID. Here is my sketch: /*HEADER TEXTGOES HERE*/#include &lt;SPI.h&gt;#include &lt;MFRC522.h&gt;#define SS_PIN 10#define RST_PIN 9MFRC522 mfrc522SS_PIN RST_PIN;void setup{ // Serielles Interface initialisieren Serial.begin9600; // SPI initialisieren SPI.begin; mfrc522.PCD_Init; // Fr spter // pinMode 2 OUTP
 I have just got the Blend Micro board.After following the getting started tutorial I can\t manage to upload sketches on the board. Now in Arduino v. 1.0.6 I see the voices Blend Blend Micro 3.3V/8Mhz Blend Micro 3.3V/16Mhz Overclock as in this picture: While the L Led is switch on if I upload the sketch the TX and RX leds stay off. The modified Arduino IDE says Done uploading. As port I choose /dev/tty.Bluetooth-Serial-1 and I don\t see any other port and I think this is critical. But if I open the Android BLE application BLE Controller after tried to upload the BLEControllerSketch from RBL_nRF8001 libraries it finds the board but print the error No Response from the BLE Controller
 I come to you again because I have a problem with the Arduino library SoftwareSerial. With a basic example I fail to see results in the serial monitor. The basic code example: #include &lt;SoftwareSerial.h&gt;SoftwareSerial mySerial10 11;void setup { mySerial.begin4800;}void loop { mySerial.printlnHELLO; delay100;} I guess it should show the string HELLO serial port but nothing appears. I have found that the baud setting is correct. The hardware is simple. Only the Arduino UNO v3 without any connected component. Thank you for your help regards 
 I bought the standard 1.77 TFT screen months ago and It has never worked. I follow the wiring diagram shown for Uno on the guide on the Arduino website and the best result I have ever got is it seeming like the screen itself is broken. I must have rewired the whole thing many times now and quadruple checked each time.As I have never used this screen before I do not know what is correct any further than the tutorial. I say that because it seems to understand instructions but does not display them correctly. I have tried multiple examples and tests on it that all yield weird results. The tests I have tried are: The SD demo that loads the Arduino icon off SD and fills the screenwith it. The serial connection says that it has successfully r

 I am trying to send a floating point number from a python script to an Arduino. I am not sure how to do this especially in a pythonic way. A little bit of research brought me to this very similar question: How to send numbers to Arduino UNO via Python 3 and the module serial I vaguely understand why this would work for an int but don\t know how to modify it. 1 In this question it makes sense to convert to a char send and then convert back to a int by casting on the Arduino I can\t think how to do that for a float. 2 Why do they convert to a Char anyway? 3 What code do I run on the arduino to get this back into a float? 4 Can I use bitwise operators on floating point numbers? I\m new to python and also to low level programming. I am also aware that python and low level don\t mix to well. I am using Linux but id

 I have an AD5685R DAC that I am trying to communicate with over SPI. Per the datasheet ...These [24] bits are transferred to the input register on the 24 falling edges of SCLK and are updated on the rising edge of /SYNC where /SYNC is used as chip-select. I believe Arduino\s SPI.transfer waits to receive 8 bits after sending 8 bits. But for this particular DAC I need to send 24 straight bits on 24 clock edges before releasing the chip-select. Is this possible?

 I am using an amazing code to send/read infrared pulses without any external library. The code is fine and I took about 1 hour to fully understand it. The only thing I didnt understand is the variable RESOLUTION. I believe it should be 0 not 20. I think it should be as low as possible. Has anyone here used this amazing code before? You can see the code at or below: https://learn.adafruit.com/ir-sensor/using-an-ir-sensor /* Raw IR decoder sketch!This sketch/program uses the Arduno and a PNA4602 todecode IR received.

 I have a code that sends 384 pulses at 38kHz with an infrared LED. Its very easy to understand it. At the beggining the code sends the pulses using the LED and in the middle of the code I check the sensor if it has any signal coming. So far so good yes? Please take a look: forint i=0;i&lt;384;i++ { digitalWriteIRledPinHIGH; delayMicroseconds13; digitalWriteIRledPinLOW; delayMicroseconds13;}if digitalReadIRsensorPin == LOW{ digitalWriteD13ledPinHIGH;} else { digitalWriteD13ledPinLOW;} My question is this: I first send the pulses so when I reach the line if digitalReadIRsensorPin == LOW{ the pulse should already have passed the sensor. So why does it work? It should not work cause I first send the pulse and then I check for the pulse but as I understand the 384 pulses should already have passed the sensor. I have no idea why this code works. I would be glad to listen smarter people to help me understan
 I\ve been trying to work with an AD5685R DAC . Per that datasheet to get DAC1 to output max voltage 5V I would perform: SPI.begin;SPI.setBitOrderMSBFIRST;SPI.setDataModeSPI_MODE3; // DAC uses CPHA=1 CPOL=1digitalWriteCS LOW;SPI.transfer0x31; // upper nibble sends a write and update command lower nibble says DAC1SPI.transfer0xFF;SPI.transfer0xFC; // 14-bit DAC last 2 bits are dontcares make them 0digitalWriteCS HIGH; Replace 0xFFFC with 0x0000 to get 0 volts out. Sending this command as written somehow writes to DAC4 instead of DAC1 ! and while 5V will come out when I write 0xFFFC I get to 2.5V when writing 0x0000 instead of 0V. If I command this with a Bus Pirate and directly write the bytes out it works exactly as
 I\m just starting to discover Arduino. Currently I\ve done 2 lessons from Arduino book and I have few questions about second circuit. Why we need to add 10kOm resistors after wire to 2 pin? Why we need to add resistors after LED? And why 3 5 6 9 10 11 pins with wave symbol? 
 So I just got an Arduino and thought I would play around a bit. However not five minutes in I already ran into a problem. I tried programming a simple SOS blinking light sequence. To get rid of code duplication I refactored the on and off turning of the LED into functions and then again refactored a short blink and a long blink function which are expected to turn the LED on for a short time and then for a long time. The problem is the delay in those functions is completely ignored. int ledPin = 13;void on{ digitalWriteledPinHIGH; }void off{ digitalWriteledPinLOW;}void shortB{ on; delay1000; off;} void longB{ on; delay2000; off; }void setup{ pinModeledPin OUTPUT; }void loop{ shortB; shortB; shortB; shortB; longB; longB; longB; shortB; shortB; shortB; delay5000;} My expected behavior would be that it does an SOS and then waits 5 seconds and repeats. What really happens howev
 I am trying to understand 2 sensors that I have here. One says that is infrared sensor of 38kHz and the other is infrared optical reflexive sensor -> http://www.robosoftsystems.co.in/wikidocs/index.php?title=TCRT_5000_Reflective_Optical_Sensor I thought that infrared sensor would tell me if an infrared light is passing on it. Infrared light has a wavelenght right? Can infrared light be emited in different frequencies? Or the frequency of infrared light is the same to all infrared lights? 
 I have a potentiometer of 10k and I connected it this way: 5v -> potentiometer -> analogic input pin of arduino When I turn the potentiometer I change the resistance of the circuit but in the arudino documentation they say that an analogic pin in INPUT mode will have 1 megahom resistance. So for example if I turn the potentiometer to the middle it will generate 5k of resistance + 1 megahom of the analog pin it will result in a tiny very tiny current. If I use U = R x I across the potentiometer it will be: U = 5000 x 0.0000001 U ~ 0 across the potentiometer. So U will be 5v at the analog input cause there was no drop of voltage in the circuit. If will turn the potentiomer all way up to 10k resistance the voltage in the analog input will also be 5v cause the voltage drop across the potentiometer is still really small. I know that an analogic pin as INPUT mode will read 0v as 0 as 5v as 1023. But as I showed you it should always read 5v even when I turn
 I have a circuit with a blue led 470ohm resistor and one IR led. I want the led to be switched off when the IR led has a digitalRead value of LOWi move my hand over it.

 Hey all this would be my first encounter needing to burn the Arduino IDE bootloader onto a blank ATMega32u4 that I bought from Digikey. What all do I need to buy in order to program the bootloader for that chip? In the manual for the 32u4 it says it comes with a bootloader but I\m guessing its not the arduino bootloader? Is the pinout for the ISP all that I would need in order to upload the Arduino bootloader? I\ve seen this post: but I wont be using the through-hole design.. its going to be the surface mount SMD kind so i wouldn\t be able to put that on a breadboard. So would it be as simple as breaking out the ISP pins on the 32u4 and just hooking those up to a Arduino Duemilanove board even if its not the same ATmega chip As in copying the atmega32u4 arduino to the Duemilanove and then transferring that to the 32u4?? 
 Socket programming question here. My interface comprises of an Android deviceclient A wireless module hosting an access point and an Arduino Unoserver. My Android client class works when 1 user connects and sends commands to my Arduino server class. I want to make my program friendly to many users at the same time. My server will only read in values from 1 connected client at a time. After some research Ive found that Arduino does not allow multithreading naturally which is why ive decided to look into a number of libraries. The Arduino library that Ive decided to use for this specific issue is protothreads . Unfortunately ive been unable to find any examples of creating a server with Arduino to accept a clients commands. Furthermore Im having a lot of trouble figuring out how to make this library work in my favor. Now for my question How exactly can I allow my Arduino server to constantly listen f
 I have been thinking of a million things to do with my Arduino but those things are extremely simple and it would leave my Arduino as a $25 waste. For example programming Arduino to control my living room lights with my smartphone ... I was thinking of connecting the Arduino in the wall onto the light switch wires. I am looking for a permanent solution but I figure this would leave me with a $25 waste of circuitry inside my wall. Are there any Arduino types of electronics that perhaps have many less ports JUST enough to get a single task done? 
 My Arduino Leonardo was working properly but for the last two hours when I connect it to a PC via a USB cable it is reporting something like USB is not recognized and even in device manager it is not showing. However when I press the restart button on the Arduino the PC will detect it as an Arduino Leonardo bootloadercom 7 but after few seconds it disappears. What do I have to do? I tried to restart the PC changed USB cable but the same issue occurs. I checked the USB by connecting another device - it works fine but the Arduino is not recognised.I tried other PCs also but the same problem continued. What do I have to do?

 My datalogging system which consits of the Flora RTC SD card breakout board LSM9DS0 sensor is shown in the picture below; https://www.dropbox.com/s/d8pwcn59nq11lzs/2014-11-25%2012.26.56.jpg?dl=0 The sampling rate/s is capped at 30 when writing into the sd card. If I disable the sensor and only save the time it goes up to 65. Writing into the serial interface rather than the sd card makes the rate goes up even higher at 127. for my application I need at least 100 samples/s. I am thinking the sd card is the problem after making the tests mentioned. The flora clock at 16Mhz is surely able to provide a higher sampling frequency. After checking the sensor datasheet and library I haven\t found any limitation either. any input on this issue? 
 Do all Arduino Mega2560s have the same VID/PID identification numbers when seen by a PC as a device? I am planning on designing I specific driver to work with the 2560 and wondering if I will be able to use the same driver for multiple Arduino. Can anyone confirm this? Thanks! 
 I am using small dc motors connected to the 5V of the arduino which is known to provide 200mA without damaging it. The motor I am using is a very common one found in toys -> https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Robotics/ROB-09608.jpg As I see the maximum current of this motor is 170mA. Does it mean that the motor will not drain more current than that or it means that I need to use a resistor in series with my 5V in order to make sure the current will not pass 170mA? 
 I\m new to Arduino and I\m trying to make a Lego based robot that I can control with Arduino. I want to use Bricktronics to connect a Lego motor to Arduino.

 Is it possible to use RXC Interrupt vector with the factory programmed bootloader still existing in the arduino pro mini ? I\ve written a simple echo program using RXC interrupt vector the program prints READY on startup but as soon the chip receives the first character it goes into a repetitive reset loop i.e. I keep receiving READY READY READY.. so on. I\ve checked the program multiple times and I think its the bootloader I think the bootloader has shifted the interrupt table to the boot section before executing the application. Is that so? Thanks in advance. 
 Ive been using a raspberry pi for a while now and wanted to attempt some home automation. From reading around Ive seen lots of people saying that the raspberry pi cant generate the timing for the signals adequately enough for it to work wirelessly with the control switches. So I was thinking about trying to use some Arduinos for this project fairly new to this however do have an Arduino uno kicking around I was looking at using the lightwave products and understand that they run on the 433 MHz band waveI also would like to integrate it with my underfloor heating devi which runs on 86842 MHz What I would like to know is if there is a transceiver that would work on both of these band waves per instruction? 
 I have a MAX5724 8 channel 10 bit DAC\s connected to a due i believe i have it wired up correctly however when i try to write a value to it doesn\t seem to output anything.

 I have an Arduino board which is controlling a servo. I think I read that I could only supply about 100 mA through the Arduinos 5v pin. Because of that the power supply I use is able to deliver about 2A I would like to split the power before the Arduino. How do I do that? Do I have to take some safety for the Aduino in concern or could I just split the wire?

 I am trying for some time to get documentation on using Java and a firmata client library for the communication between a PC and an arduino. Please note I want to use Java only i.e. not processing. Up to no I used the excellent haskell library hArduino for firmata communication with arduino boards. Now I am teaching a java course at the university as a Phd student. Therefore I need to use java. However compared to haskell there is no centralized libraries pacakges documentation as with haskell. So I used google to find more information on using firmata client libraries for java.

 I am trying to send and receive data from a PIC16F88 to an Arduino Uno. My problem is that the serial communication stops when the Arduino is not connected to the USB cable. For my application I need the Arduino to still perform its operations with a battery. I have tried both software and hardware serial. Is it possible for the Arduino to send/recieve data when not plugged into the USB cable? 
 With the code shown below I can set the desired speed values 0-255 to spin my DC motor.With arduino away from the computerI would like to add two buttons one to increase and the other to decrease the values so that I can change the set point. Probably I have to connect one pin of the button to the ground and the other to the V+ through a resistor 10K so when I press the button the input is pulled down to ground. Any help to the code?I see: Arduino UNO Random Button inputs due to change in code Can you help me to build it? Also how can I change the value 0-255 to the corresponding rpm rounds per minute? int pwm=9;int pot=A0;float value=0;int percent;float rev=0;int rpm;int oldtime=0;int time;void isr //interrupt service routine{rev++;}void setup{lcd.begin162; //initialize LCDattachInterrupt0isrRISIN
 I would like to know how I can identify a fake or counterfeit Arduino board. For example this product which is shown below. I am concerned that it is cheap about $12 when converted and I was wondering if it is like a \legal cheap version\ or is it an unauthentic one? If it is not authentic would it be legal to purchase it? 
 I downloaded a Library called Morse which I got from the Arduino website: http://arduino.cc/en/Hacking/LibraryTutorial all the way at the bottom of the page there is a link called Morse.zipAnd basically added the library. Then when I import the library it is included to the sketch. However when I try verifying it the following error message appears: to see the image clearer you can right click it and click on Open image in new tab Basically it says: In file included from sketch_nov28a.ino:1:C:\\Users\\Marko\\Documents\\Arduino\\libraries\\Morse/Morse.h:10:22: error: WProgram.h: No such file or directory Now I tried reinstalling the Arduino IDE I tried adding the library again as well as using the manual method that was stated in that first link above and the error persists.</
 I\ve stumbled upon what I\ve later found it\s quite common error but there seems not to be simple troubleshooting way and solution people often try various things sometimes they succeed sometimes not. I am using DAGU mini driver I was able to load sketch as described here - chose Arduino NG ATMega8 as board connect to my PC via USB with the driver listed on the product page . Later on I\ve plugged RedBot wheel encoders sensor and write some simplistic program to check whether it works at all. I\ve summarized the steps in a github issue so that it\s easy to reference it. When I tried
 I am trying to send data from my Arduino to my database but it seems that the process is not successfully beginning. Here is my code for Arduino: #include &lt;Process.h&gt;#include &lt;Bridge.h&gt;int temperature;void setup { Bridge.begin; // Initialize Bridge}void loop { int temperature = random0 100; Process p; p.begin143.248.181.36/db.php;// 143.248.181.36 address of localhost. p.addParameterStringtemperature; p.run; delay5000;} I am using xampp and I put db.php inside the htcocs folder. Can anyone point out why it does not work? 
 I am using an Arduino Uno R3. It is not clear on the schematic whether there are pullups on the A4 and A5 I2C pins. Are there hardwired pullups or do I have to add them myself? 
 Can I use an Arduino Uno-style Shield with the Arduino Mega Tre or Zero? How about the Intel Edison? 
 I have to use multiple timers for example to blink different LEDs with different frequency for example 7.3 Hz. Cannot you tell me what is the preferred way to implement it? Just now I use one simple TimerOne timer and just check what LEDs should be inverted and what are not but I dont think its a good idea. #include &lt;TimerOne.h&gt;#define PIN_RED 52#define PIN_GREEN 50#define PIN_BLUE 48#define PIN_YELLOW 46#define N_LEDS 4float freqs[N_LEDS] = {1 2 3 4};int pins[N_LEDS] = {PIN_RED PIN_GREEN PIN_BLUE PIN_YELLOW};long int usec_to_invert[N_LEDS];long int full_usec_to_invert[N_LEDS];boolean led_states[N_LEDS];int who_is_next{ int next_to_invert = 0; forint i = 0; i &lt; N_LEDS; i++ { ifusec_to_invert[i] &lt; usec_to_invert[next_to_invert] { next_to_invert = i; } } return next_to_invert;}void process_timer{ int to_invert_now = who_is_next; // long int time_past = usec_to_invert[to_invert_now]; forint i = 0;
 My scheme is very basic: I use RGB LED with Arduino Uno. 5v is connected to anode and pins 9-11 are connected to cathodes. When using following sketch my LED is producing white colour which red green and blue components are on: int redPin = 9;int greenPin = 10;int bluePin = 11;void setup{}void loop{ analogWriteredPin 0; analogWritegreenPin 0; analogWritebluePin 0;} But when I refer to docs for PWM: A call to analogWrite is on a scale of 0 - 255 such that analogWrite255 requests a 100% duty cycle always on When I write 0 to all pins I expect led to be off. What am I missing? 
 Im using atmega328 with Arduino bootloader to read data from MPU6050s DMP with i2cdevlib. With the example provided Im getting weird angles meaning yaw works perfectly but roll and pitch only change from -45 to 45 and its not even fluent it jumps from ~5 to ~30. Only thing I changed was the baud rate to 9600 and offsets which Im assuming are acquired by reading raw data when MPU is on a flat surface. Can anyone give me any clues as to why this happens? 
 I wrote a code to handle an ISR triggered by UART input. Im looking for 2 characters or more. I can handle extra characters and garbage values but problem arises when I get less than 2 chars specially when an empty string is sent to the atmel. The UART_receive on the atmel gets stuck at: while !UCSR0A &amp; 1&lt;&lt;RXC0 ; Is there any way I can break out of this? The code is posted below: unsigned char USART_Receive_stringunsigned char *x unsigned char size{unsigned char i = 0;if size == 0 return 0; // return 0 if no spacewhile i &lt; size - 1 { // check space is available including additional null char at end unsigned char c; while !UCSR0A &amp; 1&lt;&lt;RXC0 ; // wait for another char - WARNING this will wait forever if nothing is received c = UDR0; if c == \\0 break; // break on NULL character x[i] = c; // write into the supplied buffer i++;}
 I am making an RGB LED project right now using the Arduino UNO board. At this point everything is working fine so I would like to transfer this onto a small microcontroller circuit to be put inside the enclosure. Since the enclosure is small I cannot fit the UNO board inside it hence I want to make a small circuit on perfboard with minimal components. I read that you can burn the arduino bootloader on a standalone AVR hooked up to power filter caps and 16Mhz crystal which can then execute Arduino code. Any idea how can I do this? Also can I do this on an ATmega8l AVR since my code is small enough to fit in one? No point wasting a 328 if 8L can do the job. Thanks! 
 I\m wondering if it\s possible to flash the arduino sketch into a AVR without using a bootloader - over ISP. I\d use the BSD programmer which is basically parallel port with some resistors. Let\s say I use the Arduino IDE try to upload with verbose no actual arduino is attached - it shows path to the hex in the verbose output and I steal the file. Now I\d flash it using avrdude onto a blank 328 via ISP - would that work? I assume there needs to be a 16Mhz crystal is that it? Any other pitfalls I have to be careful about? 
 I don\t know whether I should ask here or on C# but anyway. My problem is quite simple but I can\t figure out a solution. I would like to establish a communication between my C# program and my Arduino Duemilanove. I tried lot of different tutorials but none of them were the same and I\m a little bit confused. Actually my code is: C# using System;using System.Collections.Generic;using System.ComponentModel;using System.Data;using System.Drawing;using System.IO.Ports;using System.Linq;using System.Text;using System.Threading.Tasks;using System.Windows.Forms;namespace InterfaceArduinoWindowsFOrm { public partial class Form1 : Form { public Form1 { InitializeComponent; serialPort1.PortName = COM3; serialPort1.BaudRate = 9600; serialPort1.Open; } private void pictureBox1_Clickobject sender EventArgs e { } private void tabPage2_Clickobject sender EventArgs e { } private void listBox1_SelectedIndexChan
 I have a problem in calibration an LDR sensor. I want to let the sensor goes all day long and Im using the LDR sensor as a presence sensor. The calibration values min and max changes all the day and I need to detect only the peaks or continuously change the min and the max values. Are there some defined pattern or algorithms to use? 
 Also what about the micro/nano/mini arduinos? Are they easily plugnplay like the uno?This is an edit from another of my questions 
 I had an infrared 38khz sensor that I used to read my TV remote control commands. It worked fine but I burned it. I had not another 38khz IR sensor so I tried to use my infrared reflective optic sensor like the one below: I press my TV remote control button and when I try to read the HIGHs and LOWs it does not work. The sensor shows in my Serial that it received the infrared light but it does not sense the lows/high. As far as I know this sensor is not 38khz it listens in all frequencies that are infrared. So why it does not work? It should work cause it listens in all frequencies. Why it can detect the HIGHs/LOWs that the remote control sends? 
 What would be the very minimum schematic to make a ATtiny85 blink a led? Restrictions are: There must be a C program compiled and uploaded to it just like an Arduino board would have. The code would use a simple delay to wait a little bit before changing the LED state. The LED must be controlled by a digital output port just like an Arduino board would be. This is the main question. Although I thought to ask a similar question with the restriction of blinking exactly once per second that would change completely the schema not being a MINIMAL after all. So lets restrain to the main question. Maybe some day we can discuss the version 2.0! 
 My first experience with Arduino ended in a tragedy. I bought a Leonardo from ebay and upon arrival attached it to my laptop. Programmed a simple blink demo with the onboard LED. It started working. Then detached it from USB and plugged in a 9v adapter. The board started smoking and it doesnt work anymore. I measured the voltage of the adapter and it reads 9.7v. So what is the reason of this tragedy? Edit: I think that the smoke was from a component close to the processor. Right now when I attach a 9v battery to the board both the ON LED and the L LED remains on. The processor also warm. 
 I am really despaired .i have spent a full day to understand that and it seems that i still dont . I have arduino UNO with atmega328 in which i wrote a great piece of code to it. Lateri have build a circuit on a bread boardwhere i want to use that atmega328 in 3.3v configuration and hence 8MHz oscillator . So i understood that i have to write a new boot loader to itis that correct? So i follow any guide available in there including this : http://arduino.cc/en/pmwiki.php?n=Main/Standalone and than i understood that i dont have another chipatmega328 in order to use the UNO as a boot loader . So i was trying to connect the atmega328 directly from bread board to the UNO\s serial data change the boards.txt file to add atmega on bread board 8MHz and tried to boot-loading it with out
 I have a code that reads the value of a sensor and because it needs to be very fast it does not use digitalRead but a strange form of reading. In the top of the code it shows: #define IRSENSOR PINDint irpin = 2; I have no idea why this PIND referes to my arduino pin 2 but it only work if my sensor is in pin 2. If I want to change to pin 9 and only change the irpin varialbe it does not work. Why? To read the sensor I use this code: while IRSENSOR &amp; 1 &lt;&lt; irpin { Have no idea why this work. Does anyone know this kind of programming with arduino? 
 I am trying to read my ultrasonic sensor. It sends a pulse in the trigger pin and the echo pin receives the pulse. Using pulseIn I can know exactly the time it took to the pulse go and back. But I need to use port register which is much faster and I need it to be fast in this specific case. My code is very simple: void setup { Serial.begin9600; //pin 12 as output DDRB = B00010000; //pin 12 as low PORTB = B00000000;}void loop { //pin 12 as high PORTB = B00010000; delayMicroseconds10; //pin 12 as low PORTB = B00000000; long start_time = micros; //While reading high in pin 13 keep running the loop while PINB &amp; B00100000 { } Serial.printlnmicros - start_time; delay1000;} The problem is that it does not work I mean the while loop is not being processed so the serial is always printing a very small number. It doesnt matter if I move the ultrasonic sensor to distant walls the while

 I am working on a project involving the Uno and I would like to benchmark the power requirements of Arduino. I am using the external 9V supply option. Specifically the Uno will be in to states power-intensive and power-save . In the first mode I am doing some heavy processing tasks RF and some sensors are the only external loads and the Arduino typically runs loop without any delays. In the second mode loop is execued about every 10-40 seconds. I am interested in benchmarking how much power is consumed in both states I need this to estimate the size of the battery required for the 9V supply. Obviously googling yielded me solutions that involved measuring current using chips in series with the supply I probably can pull this off with a multimeter. What I am wondering is whether there exists an elegant solution for this with highly accurate results I would most likely quote the power values so a
 I have an Arduino UNO. I\ve been reading about Pin Change Interrupts and one vector covers the Analog Pins. However is it possible to trigger interrupts using analog pins as analog inputs not digital? I actually want to analogRead a potenciometer inside the ISR. This is my code so far http://pastebin.com/ykpp78GB And my circuit is just 2 potenciometers connected to pin A0 and A1. 
 I\m working on using my Raspberry Pi Raspbian to upload sketches. However I\m not sure which package is appropriate for command line usage like described here on Github . It seems like sudo apt-get install arduino would install the whole IDE not just the command line. It seems like arduino-core would be more fitted for this purpose. However the repository has a note online to use a package called arduino-mk for a CLI which is what I want. However this concerns me in the repository\s page : This package will install a Makefile to allow for CLI programming of the Arduino platform. Emphasis mine What exactly does this mean? What are the differences between the three packages available? 
 I have written a code for my Arduino which spans multiple files In the file containing the main task i have a Global Array like this addr_t childAddr[NUM_CHILDS] = { CHILD1_I2C_ADDR CHILD2_I2C_ADDR }; where #define NUM_CHILDS 0x02#define CHILD1_I2C_ADDR 0x10#define CHILD2_I2C_ADDR 0x02 Now to debug my issue in my Task i do this Serial.printchildAddr[0];Serial.printchildAddr[1]; All i receive is 00 I looked at the issue online someone pointed it towards overshooting the RAM I am working on a Pro Mini with ATmega328P with 2K RAM. 
 Shift registers need 3 digital pins in order to work data clock and latch but Attiny45/85 chips provides 2 digital and 2 analog pins. Would I use 1 analog pin as digital pin? How? 
 Hi I have this ultrasonic sensor: http://www.micropik.com/PDF/HCSR04.pdf I use this code to read distances: digitalWritetrigPin LOW;delayMicroseconds5;digitalWritetrigPin HIGH;delayMicroseconds10;digitalWritetrigPin LOW;long time = pulseInechoPinHIGH; My question is this: in the datasheet says that the sensor will send 8 pulses at 40khz. Every pulse will take 0.000025 seconds so 8 pulses would be 200 usec. So why the delay is only 10 usec if it should be 200usec? 
 I have this simple function that produces 2 float values sum and product from which i calculate another varaible NodePrio .I had the value of NodePrio coming wrong so i decided to put in some console debug messages to read these values as they were being modified in the loopHere is the code void cycPrioCalc{float sum = 0.0 product = 1.0;for int i = 0; i&lt; 4; i++{ if loads[i].state == LOW{ if loads[i].dynPrio &gt; 1.0{ loads[i].dynPrio -= Pstep; } if loads[i].dynPrio &lt; 1.0{ // stop overshoot loads[i].dynPrio = 1.0; } } else if loads[i].state == HIGH{ if loads[i].dynPrio &lt; loads[i].fixPrio{ loads[i].dynPrio += Pstep; } if loads[i].dynPrio &gt; loads[i].fixPrio{ // stop overshoot loads[i].dynPrio = loads[i].fixPrio; } } // CAlculate the priority of the node
 I have a SIM900 board which has a serial interface. I\m trying to control it using Arduino Uno. I\ve tried using SoftwareSerial on pins 10 RX and 11 TX to talk to my board. It works OK with different baud rates SIM900 has auto-bauding. I\m connecting pin 10 directly to my board but pin 11 is connected through a voltage divider in order to lower voltage from 5V to 2.8V SIM900 uses 2.8V CMOS logic levels. But now I want to use Arudino\s hardware UART to talk to SIM900. I\m using pins 0 and 1 with similar design as above also using voltage divider. I just can\t get it to work. No matter what I do I can\t see any communication. I\ve tried different baud rates but it just doesn\t work. Here is my code: void setup{ Serial.begin9600; pinMode13 OUTPUT; digitalWrite13 LOW; delay10000; Serial.writeAT\\r; delay1000; if Serial.available { digitalWrite13 HIGH; }}void loop{} So I should see a LED light up but no
 Im working on an Arduino powered Tetris game. To keep track of the pieces that have fallen and become fixed I have an array of bytes byte theGrid[] = { B00000000B00000000 B00000000B00000000B00000000... This works great when the well is only 8 LEDs wide but I need it to be 16 wide. Is there a way to perform bitwise operations on a 16 bit number like a short? I tried just declaring theGrid as a short but Im getting this error no matter what I do. tetris:62: error: B0000000000000000 was not declared in this scope The reason I was using byte is so I could use bitread and bitset. So if an L piece comes down and lands I can bitset the appropriate bits like this bitSettheGrid[pixelY] 15-pixelX; and end up with B1000000000000000 B1110000000000000

 Im playing around with an IR receiver and an RGB led. I had it up and running until I changed around some code. The remote seeming stopped working but after looking at the values in the Serial Monitor it appeared that the values that were being printed out werent the same. After playing around a bit I found that if analogWrite is run on pin 11 the value changes. Why is this so? Code is as follows: #include &lt;IRremote.h&gt;int ir_recv_pin = 2;IRrecv irrecvir_recv_pin;decode_results results;void setup{ Serial.begin9600; irrecv.enableIRIn; }void loop{ if irrecv.decode&amp;results { //Serial.printlnresults.value; Serial.printlnresults.value == CH_MINUS; Serial.printlnresults.value; Serial.printlnCH_MINUS; analogWrite11 125; irrecv.resume; }} Output is as such when pressing the button twice in a row without holding the button down: 116

 Okay so Im using an Arduino Uno R3 and I wanted to start of my own home automation project. I have a 4 channel 12V relay board and I normally connect it to a 12V 500mA adapter. What is the maximum wattage bulb or CFL that I can power with this configuration? 
 I built my own Arduino UNO for a project at school. I think I have got the USB bootloader and Windows drivers all situated as the UNO shows up as an UNO in the device manager. When I try to load a sketch I get the error: avrdude: stk500_getsync: not in sync: resp=0x10. previously I received the same message with the message ending with resp=0x00 I loaded a serial echo program using the ICSP and sent the message serial test to the UNO. I received this message back: {u{m}owu{w Can anyone help me troubleshoot this problem as I have ran out of things to test or look into. Thanks in advance. Edit: Added requested pictures of TX and RX. These were taken at Pin 0 and 1 of the headers. The scope showed the same results at the pins of the 328P but I couldn\t operate the scope and hold the probe at the same time. 
 I know little about electronics in general. I wanted to connect Arduino and play a tone using tone through my home speakers. Ive used a 1/8 audio jack and connect ground to ground and left/right to pin 2. Run it and it was too loud. Then I read the specification and it says Input impedance = 20 kOhm Input sensibility = 400mV +/- 50mV Arduino sends 5V so that should be a lot. Did I damage my speaker? They still work.

 I have an Arduino Nano and I\m wondering what sensors and chips have currently-available arduino libraries? I should be able to wire up the sensor to the nano and use the ready code library to get started instantly without having to dig through the datasheet and spend hours debugging and wondering why the device isn\t working as advertised. I\m not talking about Arduino-compatible PCBs or Arduino shields. 
 Or at least thats what I believe is the problem. I had to add a bipolar LED library to my sketch to get them to work. As it is now I only have it activated by a specified bit so it can properly drive yellow. Green and Red were working fine the flickering problem not withstanding without the bipolar library. If I have no sensors enabled in the software java model railroad interface Im using with the sketch then the bipolar LEDs work fine. The second I add a sensor then the arduino starts polling the inputs at which time the bipolar LEDs all colors go all wonky. Their flickering coincides with the flickering of the tx/rx lights on the board so Im assuming that the polling of the sensors is what is causing it. Note that the bipolars are the only LEDs attached to another output pin instead of the ground. Its almost like its polling any pin thats low at the time which we obviously dont need/want with the pins for the LEDs. I even

 For a program that Im working on I want to get an accurate reading from a noisy pressure sensor. So the idea that I have is to do a thousand AnalogRead commands on the same port very quickly and then average them. The pressure readings become very precise however the program that I am running becomes very slow. I need my program to be orders of magnitude faster. Im sure that theres a faster way to do AnalogRead commands especially because I am requesting the same port over and over. Maybe theres a way that I can take lower resolutions of readings and then average those? I dont know. Can anyone help me? I am an amateur Arduino user looking to learn. I have done a little bit of research on my own and had trouble finding concrete examples. 
 Im trying to store a state in my data logger. I can read/write fine to SD but I cant wrap my head around reading/writing a long value correctly - Ive build it down to converting it to char array and back. My best try so far has been long temp = 1418172669L;unsigned char buf[4];buf[0] = temp &amp; 0xFF;buf[1] = temp &gt;&gt; 8 &amp; 0xFF;buf[2] = temp &gt;&gt; 16 &amp; 0xFF;buf[3] = temp &gt;&gt; 24 &amp; 0xFF;long l = buf[0] | buf[1] &lt;&lt; 8 | buf[2] &lt;&lt; 16 | buf[3] &lt;&lt; 24; But l is very different from temp - currently the output is -26371 . Am I making an obvious mistake? 
 Hello Arduino Community I am encountering an issue trying to retrieve a heart rate reading from an op-amp and instrumentation amplifier and sending it via Bluetooth. I used this website as a basis of my design: http://www.instructables.com/id/Electrocardiograph-Heart-Rate-Monitor/?ALLSTEPS . I would appreciate it if you could take a look at that. Here are a couple of pictures of my design. Here is the code that I used: const int signal = 7; // Pin connected to the filtered signal from the circuit unsigned long time; unsigned long frequency; // Internal variables int period = 2000; int starttime = 2000; int input = 0; int lastinput = 0; unsigned long death

 Im trying to check the frequency of Timer3 using a counter. The value of the counter declared as volatile is incremented in the ISR and every second the sum is shown in the main loop and the value reset to zero. The timer has been set up correctly.

 I have a circuit with a shift register which controls 8 LEDs: http://node-ardx.org/exercises/5 . In code I created a function cycle cycle through each LED one at a time but this occurs too quickly on the board. How can I add a delay inside the loop so that each LED stays on for 500ms? Here\s my code: var five = requirejohnny-five board shiftRegister;board = new five.Board;board.onready function { shiftRegister = new five.ShiftRegister{ pins: { data: 2 clock: 3 latch: 4 } }; var bytes = [ 00000001 00000010 00000100 00001000 00010000 00100000 01000000 10000000 00000000 ]; function cycle { for var i = 0; i &lt; bytes.length; i++ { console.logbytes[i]; shiftRegister.sendbytes[i]; } } this.repl.inject{ sr: shiftRegister }; cycle;}; 
 Does anyone know the location of the assembler file for strcpy and strcat for the Arduino? I wish to modify it. 
 I have the following memory allocation: unsigned char g1[]={ 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 ....0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 }; g2[]={ 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 ....0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 }; ... unsigned char* index[10] = {g1g2g3g4g5g6g7g8g9g0}; This is accessed in the following way: unsigned char* getMatchint input{ return index[input];} This is then futher acces using the method of unsigned char store[1024]unsigned char* temp = getMatchn;forint i=0;i &lt;50;i++{ store[i]=temp[i];} and store is then modified and send to an external device. As my program is randomly failing I think it might be running low on SRAM and was wondering if there is any way to force this memory to be placed in flash. Anybody got an idea? 
 I have set up a system using 4 arduino clones each wired to an NRF24L01+ radio. I am using the RF24 library by maniacbug https://github.com/maniacbug/RF24 and have set-up the nodes with 1 base node as a receiver and 3 child nodes that transmits continuously to the receiver. What I want to do is to send the read and analog value wirelessly from the child nodes to the base node as fast as possible. I used the starping example as a guide and it looks almost realtime when only 1 child node is active. When I turn on another child node most of the time the update stops for a while then continue on with randomly updating either child 1 or child 2. I\m guessing there\s a collision that\s causing the delays. How do I lessen these delays? I\m thinking of having some sort of scheduling system for the children to send their messages like child2 will send only after child1 etc. I also tried radio.setAutoAck
 I want to set one pins output value and then set a different pins output value so that the two pins change value one after the other.However the compiler optimises the two calls to change both pins in one go. PORTD |= _BV0; //set pd0 to highPORTD |= _BV1; //set pd1 to highPORTD &amp;= ~_BV1; //set pd1 to low The two pins go high simultaneously. I tried inserting a NOP between these but it doesnt change behaviour. I originally intended to include an oscilloscope screengrab to show what was happening - thats how I knew or got the wrong impression that the two pins were changing at the same time. But the photo wasnt shifting from my Nexus 7 for me to access it from my laptop.

 I have an Arduino uno board and I have a soil moisture sensor connected the digital output pin of the sensor to Arduino input pin connected an output pin of Arduino to the INPUT pin of the relay board programmed the Arduino such that if input is HIGH then the OUTPUT should be HIGH as well connected 5 v pin of Arduino to vcc of the relay board connected gnd pin of Arduino to gnd of the relay board When my sensor outputs a HIGH DO digital output the relay only creates a feeble click sound and does not get activated. The Relay board LED does light up but the relay itself does not work NC remains closed and NO remains open. Do I need to supply an external VCC to the relay board? If yes then how should I set up the circuit? A picture of the relay board is attached. You are right ... it is a 12 v relay. Do I need a 12 v external power source with IN1 coming from Arduino? Any help will be much appreciated. <i
 I used to work with PIC micro-controller so i know what it needs to work from operating circuit to crystal oscillators needed and other components to power it up my question here where can i find the operating circuit for ATmega32p-pu and other AVR models . or all i need to do is to give it +5v and gnd and it will work ? 
 I want have 2 74HC595N shift registers in series. I built this schematic When I send a value to the first register it is sent to the second one. I have same value on both. I change them master/slave but the result is the same. I connected pin 9 on the first SR first with pin 14 on the second. I am using Johnny Five on Galileo Gen 1 with shiftRegister.send25 to send the data. What am I doing wrong because several days ago I made it and it worked? 
 I\m using an RC522 RFID reader with an Arduino UNO. There is a function?? or whatever it\s called : in Miguel Balboa\s new MFRC522.h library which is mfrc522.uid.uidByte[i] that prints the bytes of the unique ID. The repetition of the function results in 8 piece of HEX digits that are from the 2 numbers that each function outputs 2+2+2+2=8. Whenever I use the line of codes that are commented out the serial monitor outputs them successfully. So for example 12345678 is the unique id each array displayed 12 then 34 then 56 then 78 which is 12345678 in the serial. which is fast and unnoticeable besides that there are no spaces included when on output. The thing is I want to output all of these into a single variable.Please help me also on how to concatenate How can I do this? An attempt was done below not commented out but it outputs only the number 16 consistently which is I think due to a data type problem. The variables are initialized as int. The function which

Thanks a lot for helping I worried erase the uploadded program so I need to take caution about this 
 Right now I have an RC car program for Arduino. The code is like this: void loop { distance = Dist.getDistanceCentimeter; ifdistance&lt;=5 &amp; distance&gt;1 ifSerial.available { lkf = Serial.read; switchlkf { case \a\: forward; servoX.write90; lkf=0; break; }} I wrote a TCPclient that can order the RC car to move forward by connecting through TCP and sending the message a to the Arduino board. The problem is how to return the distance to the cilent? Is it simply return distance; or something like system.printlndistance; ? Thanks for helping.

 Currently I have a XBee setup with 2 routers and 1 coordinator. The first router sends data to the coordinator which is then supposed to filter the data and then pass on the respectively value to the second router. However the second router is picking up data from both the coordinator and the other router. I suspect this has to do with the coordinator broadcasting considering it isn\t in unicast mode. However from my understanding if I were to set a unicast between the coordinator and the first router the coordinator will not be able to send data to the second router since it is in unicast mode. Here\s a little diagram on what I am looking for : Router A Sends 1 and 2 ==> Coordinator Receives 1 and 2 propagates 2 == Router B Receive 2 only from Coordinator. Any advice on how to achieve this in AT mode would be greatly appreciated.

 I made a soil moisture sensor out of two metal poles adjustable resistor for a project I am making. The first run with the project the sensor worked amazing and gave clear and concise readings 0-800 depending on water. I then unhooked the sensor and left it in the soil while I fine tuned the code added warnings to the areas that would read to low and while testing the code without the sensor being hooked up my arduino uno Sparkfun Pro Mini would read a value of 330area. I thought this strange but didnt worry about it. Well I hooked up my sensor just power ground and to the A1 pin and now my readout for the readings jump from 0 to 800 0 to 512 0 to another random number. I commented out everything in the code BUT the part that sets up the pin and displays the analog reading and its still the same issue. I also checked all my wires changed the resistor setting changed to a 10k single resistor nothing changed. Does anyone have any idea on what could be

 Hello Internet Arduino enthusiasts! I\m totally new to Arduino and as my first project I\d like to make a controller connected to computer A the master and computers B and C as \slaves\. The master would simply send commands as USB mouse and USB keyboard inputs to slave computers through an Arduino controller. Think of it as a hardware KVM switch without the Video. Now I\m planning to work on that during the Christmas vacations so I need to order the parts now to receive them in time. I was thinking I could use these parts: Arduino Due because it has the capability to send keyboard and mouse input 2 SparkFun FTDI Basic Breakout - 5V one for the mouse one for the keyboard per target computer https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9716 because I can convert it to a 3.3v what the Due is using Please consider: The price is not really an i
 Im currently writing a tool that automatically detects connected arduinos and provides a one-button solution for flashing new firmware.Ive got a couple of arduinos at home Diecimilla Uno R3 SMD and some nanos from china and each type presents with a different serial port name. Questions Can someone explain where these port names come from? Can I assume that /dev/cu.usbserial-A9UPDRZB is atleast in most cases an arduino nano? Are there other ways to identify the type of the board? Is the name of the serial port some kind of hash generated from informations retrieved from the device? 
 Can I ping or hello world an Arduino. Background: My son and I bought a 3-D printer kit. EZ-3D We are having some issues talking with it. Well we can\t talk at all. So we thought to upload the firmware Its an Arduino Mega 2560 and when we upload the Arduino times out but it takes a minute or two. Can I try some simpler program just to try and talk to the Arduino? Im almost a virgin Arduino user so be gentle. 
 Ive got an interesting idea to realise using my PC and Arduino but Im not sure whether it is possible to realise so Im asking for your advice. Im a novice in programming so my question may seem noob-ish. I have an XML file on a server not mine which keeps updating several times a day. It looks like &lt;x&gt;timestamp1;timestamp2;timestamp3&lt;/x&gt;&lt;y&gt;value1;value2;value3&lt;/y&gt; where the value123... are the values of a parameter at the specified time for example value1 is a value at timestamp1 etc.. The thing I want to do is to take the last value from the &lt;y&gt;&lt;/y&gt; block and to transfer it in some way to Arduino maybe through the serial port as my PC will be turned on at the time - and then repeat the operation after some time for example 2 or 3 hours to get an updated value. The remaining part to send it to the display will be easy.</
 I know how to create my own arduino library and use it. I am using Xcode to create a c++ project. I have the arduino library filesServo Wire Keypad etc. If I want to include the Servo.h library file in my created library how do I go about linking that? For some reason I cant just add the Servo.h/.cpp files in my project because then I get other linking file problems that Servo.h references and are not linked in my project. Has anyone done this before? 
 I had my sketch uplaoded and everything was working fine when I tried connecting one of the input pinspre-configured as digital INPUT to 12V just to see if this was being read as a HIGH as well.It seems to have done something and the board stopped working. Moreover all pins seem to be stuck at HIGH! So far Ive tried the following: reset button: doesnt help re-upload: doesnt work - it says not in sync Physically nothing seems to be burnt/blown. What am I missing? Have I fried my board? I hope not. PS: It was connected to a 12V external power source Any thoughts? 
 So i need an arduino board Mega 2560 that is the one that has more pins so it is the one i need i went to eBay and there are a lot of diferents boards im thinking on buing ATmega2560-16AU CH340G MEGA 2560 R3 Board + Free USB Cable for Arduino is this one good? i mean does it do the work ? is is compatible with the Arduino IDE? Anything i need to know ?

My problem is how do I give hexvalues 0x4E in Serial.write when i have an integers values say current voltage etc?** Current code: void loop{ int RP= 1391; int AP= 1581; int PF= 88; int V= 25500; int I= 62; char RPh= charbitDividerhighRP; char RPl= charbitDividerlowRP; char APh= charbitDividerhighAP; char APl= charbitDividerlowAP; char PFh= charbitDividerhighPF; char PFl= charbitDividerlowPF; char Vh= charbitDividerhighV; char Vl= charbitDividerlowV; char Ih= charbitDividerhighI; char Il= charbitDividerlowI; Serial.write0x7E; Serial.writebyte 0x0; Serial.write0x18; Serial.write0x10; Serial.write0x01; Serial.writebyte 0x0; Serial.writebyte 0x0; Serial.writebyte 0x0; Serial.writebyte 0x0; Serial.writebyte 0x0; Serial.writebyte 0x0; Serial.writebyte 0x0; Serial.writebyte
 I need to power an OpAmp based circuit that will be connected to my Arduino Uno input. Since I have a 12V adapter for the Arduino board I want to draw power from it for this opampLM358. Does anybody know if there is any way I can do this from the Arduino boardpins?is as opposed to having to solder wires directly to the bottom of the DC jack? 
 My Extech EX330 multimeter is reading 3.439Mhz on the pin 13 on my Arduino Uno running the following code. Is the reading correct? If the divider is 2 shouldnt I get 8 Mhz 16Mhz / 2? #include &lt;SPI.h&gt; void setup{ pinMode13 OUTPUT; digitalWrite13 HIGH; SPI.begin; SPI.setClockDividerSPI_CLOCK_DIV2; }void loop{ byte pot = B0; SPI.transferpot; // Do SPI transfer of variable pot}

 I want my YUN to act as a server in a client/server architecture so students can control their wifi robots via their desktops. I can plug the YUN directly into an ethernet port on our network and want to have robots communicate with it through a client/server architecture. Can somebody steer me in the right direction? 
 Does anybody know if there is any documentation available online on basic information about using displays with Arduino Uno? Ive never used displays before and would very much appreciate some basic information on the different types etc.. Any information that can help me choose what display I want to buy for my next project will be helpful. for ex: Right now I dont even know what a shield is in context to a display and whether or not I should look for one in my purchasing my display. 
 I am playing with 35 400x240 TFT display which is placed into Arduino Mega 2560 R3 board. My final goal is taking .raw data from SD card and drawing it on display.

 So I am designing a simple project where my Arduino reads analog values from a potentiometer or rotation sensor as it is called on EBay and uses that value to determine how many relays to close. I am connecting 4 digital pins to the relay module and powering it with a constant digital signal from pin 2. Here is my code: //set up the pins for activating each relay on the module#define in1 13#define in2 11#define in3 10#define in4 9#define power 2 //set up the power pin for the modulevoid setup{ Serial.begin9600; pinModein1 OUTPUT; pinModein2 OUTPUT; pinModein3 OUTPUT; pinModein4 OUTPUT; pinModepower OUTPUT; digitalWritepower HIGH; //for power to the relay module}void loop{ float rotationValue = analogReadA0; //read raw value from potentiometer float percentValue = rotationValue / 10.23; //convert the value to 0%-100% Serial.printlnpercentValue; //print it out on screen ifpercentValue &gt;
 I\m using an Uno to control NeoPixels LED strips 60 per metre. These are powered with a 5V DC supply. Now when using USB to power the Arduino it works lovely. However I want to move the Arduino into a standalone installation where I\ll only want one power supply. I\ve already got a 5V DC supply which outputs about 5.2V. What is the best way to power both the Arduino and the LEDs? I understand the need for at least 7V at the Arduino\s voltage regulator input. Would my best bet be to get a 12V supply or similar and use a buck converter to power the LEDs? The total current draw could reach 3.6A but will be 400mA for the majority of the time.

 I tried to run a sketch that tests my AVR\s interruptsI have an UNoriginal Arduino Uno and I\ve checked pins 2 and 3 like the following: - at void setupattachInterrupt2 inter CHANGE;- at void interSerial.printlnInterrupt pin 2; I did the same on pin 3 I checked them by attaching the pins to a button with a Pull-UpWhen I click the button it goes from HIGH to LOW.But yet the arduino doesn\t run the \inter\.Is it possible that because my Arduino is not original it won\t work?And this type of interrupts are software not hardware right? 
 Reading http://playground.arduino.cc/Linux/Udev there appears to be a way to write out to a FTDI USB-Serial EEPROM to set a given SerialNumber allowing you to identify a given nano/other arduino to handle it specifically in UDEV. Currently the device identifies itself with: [ 6850.608080] usb 2-1.2: new full-speed USB device number 7 using ehci-pci[ 6850.701496] usb 2-1.2: New USB device found idVendor=1a86 idProduct=7523[ 6850.701505] usb 2-1.2: New USB device strings: Mfr=0 Product=2 SerialNumber=0[ 6850.701510] usb 2-1.2: Product: USB2.0-Serial[ 6850.702201] ch341 2-1.2:1.0: ch341-uart converter detected[ 6850.704210] usb 2-1.2: ch341-uart converter now attached to ttyUSB0 Which is essentially useless as I can\t identify the given nano attached when I attach two their details are the same.

 For the past couple of weeks I have not been able to find a solution to my problem. My problem is that I cannot retrieve the data from my homemade ECG that I created from Arduino. I am a total amateur at this but I\m pretty sure it\s a circuitry issue. Here is what my circuit looks like now. Note: the thing that says \Dual O\ on the far left is the instrumentation amplifier not an operational amplifier like the one near the middle Here is the code I\m using: const int signal = 5; // Pin connected to the filtered signal from the circuitunsigned long currentBeatTime; unsigned long previousBeatTime;unsigned long frequency;// Internal variablesunsigned long period = 0;int input = 0;int lastinput = 0;void setup {pinModesignal INPUT;Serial.begin9600;previousBeatTime = millis;}void loop {delay500;input = digitalReadsignal;if input != lastinput &amp;&amp; input == HIGH { /
 I have this code which I am using with a potentiometer to control the speed of a automotive fuel injector. In it I have specified how long the injector shall stay open by using the delay functions. However whenever the code runs into a delay call it pauses the whole code for that amount of time. Although its not significantly long it would still be better if it could keeping running analogInput and at the same time run through the if statements without any interference from either. So basically run two different process simultaneously. I remember reading somewhere that this is possible with threading? But do you need a library for that? I know Python has a threading library built in and you can actually use it pretty easily but what about Arduino? How could I run these two process at the same time? Heres my code: #define in1 12void setup{ Serial.begin9600; pinModein1 OUTPUT;}void loop{ float rotationValue = analogReadA1; //r
 I am trying to control an Arduino Leonardo R3 to run some code when triggered from a Raspberry Pi this would be in a loop so that it can be ran multiple times. I have setup the Raspberry Pi and tested it with an LED and the output is working fine. I then connected this up to the Arduino and checked for a HIGH input from the RPi using an if statement. void setup{ pinMode7INPUT; ifdigitalRead7==HIGH { CODE IN HERE }} I found that this did not work as the if statement was always true because of pull up resistors not being used. I would greatly appreciate some guidance on this.

 I am moving my Arduino project to another platform operating at 3.3V. 5V from USB not useable due to some 3.3V-only chips in the design Having read about this it seems that 12MHz is a good speed to use and my stock USB to UART converter CH340G does call for a 12MHz crystal. Now what is the best way to share this 12MHz clock between CH340 and ATmega328P eliminating an extra crystal? Can I tap off XO pin from CH340 with crystal attached and carry it to the XTAL1 pin of the ATmega? EDIT If sharing clock requires some fine tuning what about building a reference clock out of 74LVC1G04 and 74LVC1G06 chips and clock both chips from this? 
 When I use the Mega 2560 additional serial ports I realize that it is active low active high. I know that TTL is active high and the serial port is obviously stated in arduino serial port page.I also found out that the receive pin flashed put an LED when I typed in to the serial monitor. Is this a mistake or problem? 
 I am trying to simply send a digital output from the Raspberry Pi to trigger some code on an Arduino. I have setup the Pi with the digital output working fine tested using LED however I cant seem to get the Arduino Leonardo to read this output. I mean all the details about the Pull Up resistor and logic having to be low to be high is confusing me and I really dont want to use any other electronic components ie transistors or switches etc. Is there a simple way of just reading the output and triggering the code on the Arduino? 
 I have not used the Arduino in quite sometime so i am rusty in programming the device but i am getting back into it through the tinyduino. I was wondering if someone could help me? I currently have 2 analog sensors and an accelerometer attached to my tinyduino all which are working fine. I would like to however transmit this serial data to an android or I phone. Along with the micro controller i purchased the bluetooth LE shield found here from what i understand this is the hardware i need in order to complete the task. I have unfortunately not been successful following their example here . Ultimately I would like for tinyduino to send information from these sensors to my mobile device via bluetooth le and for an application to store and display the data as a graph. Does anyone know how i would go about doing this?

 I have three devices for making a motion activated security camera system: this is the camera : LINK OV 7670 this is the SD Card module: LINK and a basic motion Sensor: PIR with 3 pin I have an Arduino UNO and an Arduino Mega 2560. I can connect the SD card and sensor they work fine but I cannot connect the camera as there are not enough pins for it on UNO. Is there a chance to connect all of them without any additional device? I saw some working project with additional device arducam but I do not have much money to spend on this project.

 I plan to build functioning reaction wheels controlled by an Arduino Micro. Ideally Id like to have the reaction wheels and the micro be a single unit which would receive external commands from another microcontroller. I know you can link Arduino microcontrollers and every time Ive seen it done it has been with a RC module such as XBee. Is it possible to link units using something like the micro-usb on the Arduino Micro? If this is possible is it as simple as connecting the micro-usb ports on my microcontrollers and then working out the programming?

 I understand that A-B plug used to be common but they could have switched to micro without issues. My questions: Why does Arduino use USB A-B plug instead of A to micro USB plug? What are the challenged Arduino would be facing if they switched to micro USB? Note:By Arduino I\m referring to Arduino models that do not come with a micro USB port such as the most common Uno &amp; Mega. 
 I\m new in robotics. I bought a mini robot Link which i rebuilt a little. Now it has legs and arms. This little robot has 4 little servos Link . There are two wheels attached to two of these servos. I\d like to spin them so the robot will roll but unfortinatly it is trickier than i tought. The servos can rotate in 360 degreesi can manually turn them no problem with that. The problem is that no matter how i try the servo will turn only 180 degrees. So obviously i am making something wrong. If i write myServo.write0 the servo rotates 180 degrees and if i write myServo.write180 the servo rotates 180 degrees but in the other direction. How can i make it spin in only one direcvtion360 degrees more than 360 degrees? Thanks in advance! 
 On an embedded system we use global variables often to keep dynamic memory consumption on heap and stack low. But global variables are also considered bad programming practice if they arent used in a global sense i.e. they are used only inside one or two functions. So I really want to make use of the possibilites to protect my code from myself. Of course the instantiation mechanism of c++ is to avoid on an embedded system with low resources like an arduino. So I write classes with static members and member functions only. Many of the libraries shipped with arduino seem to work this way too. Im curious if theres a single drawback of moving static variables or even const arrays designed for deposit in progmem from global namespace to a class namespace and making them private? Im primarily interested in drawbacks arising from the combination of OOP with the arduino platform using an arduino uno with avr-gcc. 
 I am trying to make the photoresistor work in a simple project. The project is as follows:The LED light should light up brighter and brighter as the photoresistor reads less light in the room. The problem:The reading is fixed on 1023. Therefore the LED never lights up. I cannot understand why.. Sometimes if I cover the sensor the readings go down to 900- 950 but never less even though it is completely dark around the sensor. Is there something wrong in the code? What could have gone wrong?Please note that the resistor connected to the sensor is 10k Ohm as is the one connected to the LED. Here is the code int photoPin = 0;int pReading; // analog readingsint LED = 11; // red LED connected to pin 11int LEDbrightness; //void setup { //set up the serial connection Serial.begin9600;}void loop { pReading = analogReadphotoPin; Serial.printPhotocell reading = ; Serial.printlnpReading; // Analog reading pReading = 1023 - pReading; //map 0-

 I have an Arduino Pro Micro clone that seems to be in some sort of reset loop.The RX LED is flickering very fast and very dim.The power led also seems to flicker at the same frequency but has normal brightness. The arduino is not recognized by the PC at all anymore. It was working fine before.Another clone from the same shipment is still working fine. Both running the blink sketch. Just this one started to malfunction all of the sudden after probing the pin I set in the blink sketch with my multimeter to see if the flashing was a success. 
 I have two Arduino Due boards. I would like to connect one to my computer through the programming port as USB Serial so that I can send it commands but I would like it to also be able to communicate to a second Arduino Due as the host on the native USB port. I see in the manual that it has drivers for acting as a host to USB Mice and Keyboards but is having it load appropriate drivers for communicating with another Due doable? I\ve done plenty with the USB ports but never as a host so I\m not really sure how to start. The goal is to have one master Due connected to the computer that controls a complicated piece of equipment with a lot of supporting electronics and a second peripheral Due that acts as an interface for the user. The master would accept commands either from the computer or from the peripheral. Reason is that the peripheral has to have fast interrupts to handle rotary encoders and the like the master Due is quite busy so those interrupts can be t

 How does the Light Bulb Controlled by PhotoresistorLDR + Arduino Works ? I can understand if the Darkness increasesDaylight Decreases the Arduino then starts the Light Bulb and if Daylight Decreases the Light Bulb will be switched Off but when daylight goes down and then arduino starts light bulb wont the bulbs light effect the PhotoresistorLDR and it may think that there is light and so it will switch off the Light Bulb again ? or do i have to place the LDR someplace other than near the Light Bulb ? i am working on Light Controlled by PhotoresistorLDR using Arduino and i want to control 240 V Light Bulb. 
 In the normal case the setup function will be run once automatically and and then the loop function will run many times. I want to initialize several modules in the setup function and then in the loop I want to read values from them periodically. But if the period between usage is long I want to power off the modules. After defined time the modules will be powered on again and need to be initialized. Can I use the already existing setup function inside the loop to initialize the modules or I have to write another similar function? Is there any other better way to power off/on sensors and modules during the execution of code.

 I want to create a small position reporter for cars. I found some good GPS Modules with which i could collect data. But im unsure with what technology i should send the data. A possibility would be to setup a service in the www which is feeded by the arduinos. I want to track the data live. so i think GPRS should be the right choice ?Or more better are there any shields which make this GPRS LOG and SEND as a package ? Which GPRS hardware would you use ?Would you use something else? Any hints are very welcome 
 The Photon from Spark IO looks super small. Are there smaller wifi enabled microcontrollers available that can be programmed with the Arduino IDE? 
 So I have a project Im working on where I have about 6 arduino boards communicating with one another through cables. Ive been testing them using a regulated DC PSU and at some point I caused a short and since then I cant upload any sketches onto the arduino. On some of them the TX pin will light up while trying but RX wont and the IDE tends to freeze after around 90% of the upload process is complete. Does anyone know how badly I screwed up? How do I avoid this next time? Is there an easy fix? Thank you! 
 The product in question - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9825 - operating at 5 V and can also supply it to the device being programmed. I need to program the bootloader onto a 3.3 V ATmega328p and don\t have any level shifters immediately available. Thus the question. The Hookup Guide for the product https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pocket-avr-programmer-hookup-guide seems to suggest that it will work fine as long as the 3.3 V device being programmed isn\t powered by the programmer. I wouldn\t have thought it\s the best idea in the world but maybe I\m wrong. So any practical experience? Are the over voltage tolerances for input lines on Atmel devices good enough to handle the extra voltage? I guess the output level from the device being programmed would be high enough to be buffe
 I have a minor issue with my ECG. When I poke at the leads I get a reading. But when I hold the leads or place it near my heart I don\t get anything. I\m pretty sure this is hardware related but I don\t want to completely rule out a potential software problem. I used this YouTube video as a guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDjRg-KgIXY . My breadboard almost looks exactly the same as that but with a couple of changes. Instead of connecting the ECG to the computer via a audio cable I used Bluetooth to transfer it to my phone. Here is my schematic diagram. Here is my breadboard diagram. In my breadboard I used three LM358 op-amps. Here is my Arduino code if you need it: const int signal = 7; // Pin connected to the filtered signal from the circu
 I have a small office with wireless network is it possible to make a wireless doorbell? Practical example: Arduino is connected to the main wireless network and has a static ipi have a website that connects through arduino using ftp to activate the open door function. note: open door activates a motor to press the button or i will hack the current doorbell to connect wires :D 
 I had an idea to create a control panel using an arduino and some buttons. How would I go about making the arduino emulate an input device so that when I press a button connected to the arduino it would cause the same effect as when a keyboard key was pressed? Im using arduino UNO if it helps. Thanks in advance. 
 Im pretty interested in arduino and the things I can learn from it. Being that Im new into this I wanted to know which model I should get that would be easiest to learn on and why. What does this model come with how much and reputable place where one can purchase this. 
 I\ve just cracked out my Franzis Arduino Tutorial Kit Best Xmas Present EVER! and I\m already stuck on my second program. I successfully wrote and executed a basic \blink\ program however when I wrote out the second program provided in the manual I get an \Error Compiling\ when trying to check the syntax or run the program.

I\m trying to wrap my head around on how to convert it to a finished product that sits inside a plastic box. What are my options? For instance can I create a single PCB that contains all the components? If not how can I connect these multiple break-out boards together? Is soldering some wires on both boards to connect them is a viable option? Edit: My ultimate goal is to create a product that is for sale. So I mean something that can be mass-produced and can meet regul
 How does an arduino microprocessor compare to some of the older computers in RAM and computational speed? Like how does it compare to the Intel 400 or the original IBM PC. Im interested in both the Atmega328 and the 2560. Just how much better/worse is the arduino compared to an old computer? 
 I am attempting to program my arduino in plain C and Ive come across some very strange behavior. If I load the following code from the Arduino IDE it works as expected and toggles Pin 6 every 100ms.

 I was hoping to create a cheap security system by connecting an Arduino to the phone line output of a base station. Since the base station should call a phone number if the alarm is tripped I wouldnt have to do much hardware hacking so long as I can read/parse the output from the base station. My question is can I read serial output from a phone line like this? 
 I have a Arduino Pro Mini clone to which I am trying to upload the Blink sketch. I am on Ubuntu 14.04.

 Im working on an Arduino project involving an UNO. Im powering a 20x4 LCD screen and I am using all the ports on the Arduino to the last. All but four of them are pulled high at any given time so by the time Im done with pulling them all up the screen is going dim when powering via USB. So I tried powering via an external 9V 600mA adapter but that makes the Arduino overheat and eventually shut down.I then tried another 12V 500mA adapter and that one doesnt even get my UNO to the end of the setup function and it reboots repeatedly. Anyone got good advice? Ideas? 
 I need to make circuit in which orange LED will light only when yellow and red are disconnected. When one of buttons is pushed orange LED should turn off. See my attempt at it below. I am new to electronics so your help is very appreciated. EDIT: After many atemps I managed to build this circuit as on left side of schematic tested on live breadboard but my primary goal is to make this work with RGB LED. I took Common Anode RGB LED for this and build circuit on right side of schematic. I do not have such RGB LED to test it live so I ask you to review if that schematic will work as it has few changes to one with 3 LED\s. Thank you SOLUTION: Thanks to Bruce\s help my circuit now works. 3 separate LEDs emulate common anode RGB LED as I do not have one to test cir

 I would like to prototype a bridge from a Bluetooth sensor client to the cellular network using an Arduino to control the communication between the Bluetooth sensor and the internet via the cellular network. I find much written about apps on ones mobile to connect to the BLE devices however not the other way around. Is it possible to use something like an RFDuino to implement the BLE host to which the BLE sensor would pair - and then have the RFDuino push data out a cellular device like the FONA from Adafruit? UPDATE: Ive since read that apparently the Bluetooth protocols allow masters and clients to switch roles dynamically - which would lead me to believe that I can program a BLE device as either master or client. I also looked at a BlueGiga device which specified it could run as Master or Client. Not sure if the hardware needs to support the different modes. 
 I just started to use the unusual part of Arduino language avr like interrupts accessing registers etc in Arduino IDE. I wrote a program to calculate the frequency of a digital signal using external interrupts. The following code is to calculate timeperiod of a digital signal the output of the color sensor TCS3200 which depends on the color filter choosen via S2 and S3 pins as in the code. That is color sensor produces 50% duty cycle square pulses of frequency dependent on the power of the light incident on it. So when sensor faces red color output signals frequency in red color mode by setting S2 S3 pins is more than the frequency in blue and green modes. Thus we can detect the likeliness of the color which it faces w.r.t RGB. When this code is uploaded in the Arduino it failed to print the values as expected in the serial monitor i.e. its stuck in while loops. But when Serial.printe statement in the while loops are uncommented it is ab
 Im looking for a storage solution for small files that would be moved into a small sensor running arduino-like processor.

 Im very new to using Arduino! Ill be using Ocean Controls KTA 259 thermocouple multiplexing shield AND a Sparkfun microSD shield on my UNO--to log temperature data for a study Im doing. The KTA 259 has a library and the integral SD library should work for the SD shield. Q1: I believe they physically connect no problem but how can I be sure there are no pin conflicts disastrous or otherwise? In other words--what conditions MUST I avoid using shields and multiple shields? Q2: Can or must a single data pin be used by both shields eg from thermo as output to SD as input or does Arduino juggle all that?Q3: Can or must a single function eg CS be mapped onto the same pin on BOTH shields or do they have to be separate allowing Arduino to handle that?Thank you; I appreciate the help! 
 i have some data logging to do. And i want some what accurate time meaning accuracy has to be +/- 1 minute. I have considered a RTC but then i thought. When i was 10 i got a watch that kept time from this radio clock. And if it is possible 20 years ago to make a clock that updates automatically in such as small form factor then i should be able to do it with my arduino today. Does anyone know of a guide/solution with components where i can read this atomic radio clock? 
 I am trying to communicate with a clientPC from my arduino set up as a server with a sim900 module connected via UART. I have successfully got it to register its IP address with a dynamic DNS provider no-ip.com and set up a TCP server using the AT+CIPSERVER command for the sim900. All this is done in setup. After that in loop it waits for a client to connect. The moment a client connects the problem arises.

 I\ve been playing with Groove Bluetooth Module HM-11 and for some reason my computer can see it but none of my cell phones can. I\ve tried two Huawei P7 BL 4.0 + BLE as well as some Samsung Galaxy &amp; some older sony with Bluetooth 2.0. None of the cell phones can see the device. Any ideas? 
 I have no idea why this is happening but after I open COM port to talk with my Arduino I click Open in RealTerm the state of some pins goes from high to low for about 2 seconds and then goes back to high. Here\s my code: void setup{ pinMode5 OUTPUT; digitalWrite5 HIGH; Serial.begin9600;}void loop{} In this case pin 5 will behave this way. I\ve checked it also for pin 6 and pin 8 and they behave in the same manner. I suppose more pins act like that. Why is this happening?

 We have two labs - one in 1st floor and other at 2nd floor. We are connected by intercom - both the labs has one device each. The issue is that the person who sits near the intercom is busy through out day answering the intercom and reaching out to the person for whom the call is made for. This is very tiresome and hence I wish to automate this. I have an Arduino Mega 2560 board. My plan is to make Arduino receive the call ask for the person whom the caller is reaching out and play the name loudly over speaker in all rooms of labs to attended the phone. If the user does not turns up even after 3 repeated times of calling - disconnect the call. If the user answers the phone by picking up the receiver then turn the conversation speaker mode off until call has not ended. I have Arduino Mega 2560 board which has 4 serial ports but I am not user what would be the circuit to make this functionality workable? What are the extra h/w required and concept of its implementation.<

 I accidentally misconnected a USB BUB II to a Arduino RBBB atmega 328 and it no longer uploads code. Here are the symptoms I think the BUB II is fried. I am using Ubuntu 14.10. Code wont upload with error ser_recv: programmer is not responding The RBBB board will reset is I hit the button. Evidenced by the LED flashing in port 13 Prior code runs as expected dmesg behaves normally upon USB connection When I short the Rx and Tx terminals of the BUB II I can send instant reply messages via the Serial Monitor Does this sound like the USB BUB II is broken? Or is is possible that some component on the RBBB board is fried?

 I am working on a project for grade 10 computer science. I am supposed to make a piano that has 7 keys using a capacitive sensor and the piano is supposed to teach you songs like Twinkle Twinkle Little Star by illuminating the LED corresponding with that key and then playing that tone on the speaker. There is also a random scales part where you are timed and have to press the keys as fast as you can as they light up. Unfortunately I have come into a few problems. I ran out of outputs and have to use a shift register. I have no idea on how to control each of the outputs. When the game starts I want there to be 2 options a song and a random scales using randomSeed however I have NOT found a way for them to pick which option. I think I can do user input by typing or by them just pressing a key but I am not sure. I am pretty new on Arduino so anything helps. Finally I am using the Arduino Uno and that is why I am short pins beca
 Despite many articles on the topic of vehicle platforms none of them seem to recommend the best one to start with. Later on I am sure I will seek an exact kind of chassis for autonomous vehicle construction but now I am looking to learn the basics of this area of the Arduino world. If you could give me a simple recommendation for the general category of vehicle platform to use it would be much appreciated. I will be using an ultrasonic distance sensor coupled with a servo motor to detect obstacles so it is a very simple project. Thank you so much. 
 Im starting a decently sized project around arduino/ATMELavr and I came to wonder if there are any commonly accepted C/C++ coding standards or style guidelines specifically aimed at embedded C++/arduino. Ive worked mostly with python recently and came to love the PEP8 guidelines and the associated pep tool which checks syntax consistency with the style guide.Similarly Ive used jslint and similar tools for javascript as I find they help keeping your code base homogeneous and avoid wasting time and commits on silly typos and arguing over where the braces should go. Any similar tools for C++ or more specifically arduino C++? 
 I have five accelrometer sensors MMA 7361 connected to the analog channels of Arduino Duemilanove. I am using the following code to read the data. I am reading from only one axis from each sensor. #include &lt;avr/io.h&gt;#include &lt;avr/wdt.h&gt;int sensorValue = 0; // value read from the potvoid setup { Serial.begin9600; // initialize serial communications at 9600 bps:}void loop { // read the analog values: int i=1; Serial.printACS#; fori=0;i&lt;5;i++ { sensorValue = analogReadi; Serial.printsensorValue; Serial.print#; delay10; } Serial.println;} I am using a delay of 10 after reading each sensor. What should the value of the delay I should be using after reading one sensor to get the correct values from the sensors? 
 I just recently bought an Arduimu v3. Rather annoyingly they did not supply an FTDI cable. Im going for an FTDI cable where the I/O pins are configured to operate at 5v. I assume this is the right but I dont want to fry this board. Is this cable OK? 
 So I will admit that I am a noob to Arduino. I have some experience programming microcontrollers and that was back in the day about 4 years ago - such as the Freescale 68HC12 so up until this point I thought I was experienced enough to get this Arduino Mega2560 rocking with AVR C using Atmel Studio and avrdude by lunch... Wrong. I believe I\m getting held up at what\s possible... What I want to accomplish: Write and compile a program in AVR C within Atmel studio. Use the hex file that was built and download that to the Mega. Keep in mind I was planning on using USB and Arduino as my programmer between PC and ATMega2560 as per this gentleman\s example... https://balau82.wordpress.com/2011/03/29/programming-arduino-uno-in-pure-c/ -- however I was not using his code and he was compiling using avr-gcc... Question: Is thi
 I am working on a beat detection device which I received good help from in my earlier question this week. I am using Open Music Labs FHT library for Arduino to read Analog Input 0 andtranslate the incoming signal to an frequency spectrum range. According to the article found at the bottom of the question the prescaler of the ADC will affect thesample rate which in turn affects the range of frequencies availableat the end of the FHT process. So basically how do I change the prescaler and what is the lowestsetting of the prescaler? Altrnatively where can I find a list of the different prescaler modes? Goal: I need to broaden the lower frequency range so that I properlycan distinguish the kick from the bassline and other elements of the music.The kick will be the most important factor for the beat detection algorithm. What Ive already tried: Changed a variable value of the Open Music Labs Arduino sk
 Im dealing with arduino mega based quadcopter and trying to make PWM frequency for 4 motors = 400hz.Ive found an interesting solution where 4 ATmega2560 16bit timers are used to control 4 ESCs with PWM so it could reach 400hz frequency. 1000 and 2000 are normal widths ESC are dealing with. 1sec/REFRESH_INTERVAL = 1/0.0025 = 400hz. this is servo.h lib:#define MIN_PULSE_WIDTH 1000 // the shortest pulse sent to a servo #define MAX_PULSE_WIDTH 2000 // the longest pulse sent to a servo #define DEFAULT_PULSE_WIDTH 1500 // default pulse width when servo is attached#define REFRESH_INTERVAL 2500 // minimum time to refresh servos in microseconds #define SERVOS_PER_TIMER 1 // the maximum number of servos controlled by one timer #define MAX_SERVOS _Nbr_16timers * SERVOS_PER_TIMER The problem is to make it work each PWM should be controlled with 1 16bit timer. Otherwize say 2 escs on 1 timer would give 200hz. So all

But when I initialize the val1 to val4 as byte the desired number doesn\t appear. I don\t intend to print the uID to serial as someone may suggest that to readily print to serial as it converts it automatically to some ASCII strings but instead in the client.print of the Ethernet library along with other codes. I want to save it into another greater variable in terms of speed and memory allocation. The Arduino community warns about the use of String as it uses additional decoding which is not needed as well as may crash Arduino and make Arduino run out of memory. An
 Im attempting to read data from my SD card but I have strange behavior and cant figure out why this is happening. Im using CardInfo from the Arduino example and am trying to read the data from my SD card. Im faced with two different problems but maybe they can be related: 1: If I format my SD card from my Mac FAT32 if my card is still empty the program can read my card and output the right information. But if I add data from my Mac to the SD Card card.init never initialise and my data are never read because of the hidden files. If I remove those hidden files but let only the expected files be the program never find them like if my card was still empty. I dont know how to handle this. 2: From my Arduino if I feed the card from the 3.3&nbsp;V output I get the Card type: SD2 Could not find FAT16/FAT32 partition. Make sure youve formatted the card It o

 I am in the last 2 weeks trying to build a self balancing robot using arduino + lego parts. I am using PID with MPU6050 to create data fusion and my robot can balance itself well with small pushes. But there is a problem. Please see this video I just made a few minutes ago: If I just wanted to keep this robot stand still it would be fine but I want to be able to control it with my RC. The problem is that after a small push or I make it start running to one side it doesnt stop anymore. I already used lots of ki kp and kd different and using many methods to set this constants but this problem never goes away. I see many other people online with exactly same problem but no solution despite using an encoder. But some solutions like sainsmart bot does not use encoder and he can control his bot with a remote control and it starts stops make turns... I would be glad to know how to solve this problem. Is arduino too slow to process this kind of thing? Would raspberry pi be b
 There are two files that can be seen on my computer on my sd card 6.bmp and example.txt the latter written from my arduino. I have them connected to my arduino via LCSTUDIO breakout board which surprisingly caused me no trouble at all. When I run the example cardinfo sketch the files it lists includes those two files along with tons of others which I assume are just invisible from a personal computer. How would I list only the files that can be seen from my computer i.e. aren\t inside any directory but are just plain in the SD card? Using arduino UNO 
 I\m working on a function to fade RGB LEDs smoothly from one color to the next so I thought I\d use a for loop to increment each RGB value according with the set value. I\ve made the for loop as following: for redFadeCurrent greenFadeCurrent blueFadeCurrent; redFadeCurrent != redFadeTarget&amp;&amp; greenFadeCurrent != greenFadeTarget&amp;&amp; blueFadeCurrent != blueFadeTarget; redFadeCurrent = redFadeCurrent + redStep greenFadeCurrent = greenFadeCurrent + greenStep blueFadeCurrent = blueFadeCurrent + blueStep { analogWriteledRedPin redFadeCurrent; analogWriteledGreenPin greenFadeCurrent; analogWriteledBluePin blueFadeCurrent; Serial.printRed: ; Serial.printredFadeCurrent; Serial.print Green: ; Serial.printgreenFadeCurrent; Serial.print Blue: ; Serial.printlnblueFadeCurrent; delay3000; if redFadeCurrent&gt;redFadeTarget { redStep = -1; } else if redFadeCurrent
 I bought these rgb\s from Sparkfun however I have no idea how to hook them up or how to program them. Obviously the data sheet was somewhat helpful however I have no idea how the IC\s in the LED\s work themselves or how to control them separately or even how to string them together. My best guess is currently going for what the led\s appear as in the example picture by connecting the first and last pins and putting the respective Vcc and ground pins to Vcc and ground. Is there any good examples for hooking these up and coding them or a basic understandable explanation for how they work? Thanks I can\t find a great resource yet. 
 I was just playing around a bit and ran into a strange problem. LED 3 5 6 9 and 10 are on as intended. For some reason LED 0 and 1 are on as well.

 I was trying to reset my Arduino Yun WLAN button pressed for more than 30 seconds but it just kept on blinking for about 10 minutes. Then I finally got impatient and restarted the Yun. After the restart there was no WLAN blue or USB white LED blinking or glowing anymore. I am unable to connect through the Wifi network the Yun does not create its own Wifi network and unfortunately when connected via Ethernet I can still not navigate to arduino.local or 192.168.240.1. So I have a feeling that somehow only the AVR is still functioning because I can still upload sketches and nothing else. I have updated the firmware to the latest version OpenWrt-Yun 1.5.3. Is there a way to connect or reset if the Ethernet does not work? Can I upload a sketch to check in the console if the Linino interface still functions. Thanks in advance! 
 I am using Arduino uno board with Atmega 328 for i2c.The ic is not showing any clock signal on its SCL line on oscilloscope The same code when used with different new atmega 328 and same code. It is showing a good clock signal on oscilloscope. The ic whose i2c is not working can be still programmed and can be used for other purposes like serial communication adc etc. So is there any way by which i can confirm and surely say that i2c of my atmega 328 is fried up. And what can be the possible methods by which it can be fried up. 
 I wanted to check how much memory RAM is used by an empty sketch. Here is my code: int freeRam { extern int __heap_start *__brkval; int v; return int &amp;v - __brkval == 0 ? int &amp;__heap_start : int __brkval; }void setup{ Serial.begin9600; Serial.printlnfreeRam;}void loop{} My result was that I have 1839 bytes of free RAM. I have an Arduino UNO so there are 2048 bytes of RAM in total. Which means that 209 bytes are already taken. Wait 209 bytes?! I started thinking and figured out that the Serial buffer must take some space. I\ve opened HardwareSerial.h and found this: #if RAMEND &lt; 1000 #define SERIAL_BUFFER_SIZE 16#else #define SERIAL_BUFFER_SIZE 64#endif I\ve changed SERIAL_BUFFER_SIZE to 16 to see what will happen. I\ve tried decreasing it to 1 but then the serial communication didn\t work properly and I wasn\t able to display the amount of free RAM. After this modification m
 I want to run an Arduino autonomously - but although I apply a watchdog sometimes the systems hangs and can only be restarted by physically interrupting the power-supply or hitting reset. So I need an external source to do that either after x hrs or based on a condition. Instead of using another Arduino with a MOSFET or relay I am asking myself if this couldnt be done smarter with a pure electronic component like a timer or a capacitor. I could set a pin of the Arduino on high while it is active and let this charge a capacitor or something similar - if the time/energy exceeds a certain amount because it hangs this would connect the reset-pin of the Arduino to ground. Any idea how this could be achieved and what component should be used?

 So I was wondering if someone could tell me of a method by which I can power a group of 12 motors via UK mains I assume resistors or something will be needed to reduce the voltage down to that which can power the motors. I then want to control the motors with an Arduino. The main reason for this is that this will continually on and I figure powering 12 motors via batteries would be quite expensive. The motors are DC and have been salvaged from DVD and CD players.

 So Im using the HC-SR04 modules to get the distance to objects the problem is that if its not a perpendicular surface I dont get any reading and I assume that the reason is that the ultrasounds get reflected in another direction so they dont come back to the sensor.

However recently I\ve only been able to upload anything using one of the PCs the other produces: Arduino: 1.5.8 Windows 8 Board: Arduino UnoSketch uses 26002 bytes 80% of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes.Global variables use 1516 bytes 74% of dynamic memory leaving 532 bytes for local variables.

I find it odd that I can upload the same sketch on a different computer fine and that it used to work before. I\ve tried reinstalling the software etc and have had no success.

 I have a need for a bill counter at my current job but besides counting bills we also could use a machine to count admission cards. The idea is to either buy a bill counter machine like those that the Banks have or make one from scratch by buying the parts.Besides the bill counting feature i wanted to make it so that it also counts the certain number of cards and check if they are either stamped or not. My question is: Is this possible? If so is it easier to just buy a arduino and use it with other parts sensors moving gears etc etc or to buy a bill counter and just crack the OS? Any insight would be appreciated! PS: I am a 1st year Computer Science student but i have 0 experience in programming in Arduino 
 If so let me know the steps needed. Thanks!

 I am trying to do an experiment with Arduino Uno r3 board plus a 2-channel relay shield. What I need to do is to alternatively turn on and off the relay shields. So it requires multiple compile and upload of the program to assign values to corresponding pins. What I have seen by now is that uploading the program to Arduino is a kind of painful process and it requires nothing to be connected to pins 0 and 1 to prevent synchronization errors. So I was wondering how I can do my experiment without having to mount/unmount relay shield each time I want to upload a new program into it. Thanks in advance

 Im new to Arduino. Im using Arduino Mega 2560 board &amp; MATLAB Simulink-Arduino support package and trying to integrate Maxbotix Sonar and Sharp IR sensor for my class project. When I powered single US sensor from Arduino 5V output the readings are fine. However when I tried to power IR sensor in parallel with US sensor IR readings are fine but US readings fluctuate. So I tried powering the sensors using BEC 5V-3A. The readings for both sensors are fluctuatingextremely noisy. From the specification mentioned by manufacturers Maxbotix US sensor draws 2mA of current whereas IR sensor averagely draws 20mA. Is there any way to solve this problem? Thank you.

How would I code so that say the belt moves forward for x seconds and then after time it moves backwords for y seconds. Any basic idea on the code would be great thank you. I could do the basic code but I just need help with timers part. Thank you 
 How can I turn my arduino into a USB Bootstrap loader for programming the MSP430g2xxx series chips? 
 Is using PWM tones from Arduino amplified by a HiFi amplifier safe? Can I damage the amplifier or speakers because the PWM signal is not a real audio signal? Taken in consideration that I do not clip the signal and using a RC Low Pass Filter to filter out inaudible frequencies and using a LM386 amplifier chip to amplify and control the volume? I am developing a synth/sampler project based on the Arduino Uno r3. This is my first electronics project ever and because of that reason I have some questions which I can\t find a definite answer for on internet. The synth has two function. It has a tone generator using the ToneAC library. With code I have mimicked LFO and VCO functions using potmeters I can adjust the frequency and LFO speed realtime. The other function is that I can trigger samples stored on a SD card using the TMRpcm library. The lowest frequency which can be played is 100hz and the highest 3100hz. The device will be used in nightclubs on high
 I want to connect an Android Galaxy S2 phone to my UNO Arduino using USB OTG functionality.I can upgrade/root the android to any version I want. My goal is to be able to communicate between the devices send/receive data. Ive tried to search for whether thats possible but found conflicting answers whether Galaxy S2 and the Arduino UNO would be able to be connected this way. Anyone knows whether this is possible? If yes - Do I need to do anything special - such as rooting the device flashing it to a certain rom or something like that? Thanks in advance!

 i am having an issue where i am unsure how my device knows what pins its using. Version #1 is a timeclock which is simply declared with no pin numbers. Version #2 is a simple loop with a device on pin A0; So how can i set / change the pins for the clock to use. Currently it is on A4 &amp; A5. If i wanted to move the clock to say pins.. A1 and A2 how would i do that?

 could you advice how to amend such schema in order to measure humidity on more probes? http://emesystems.com/images/smx/SMX555sc.gif My idea is to have one NE555 and some sort of switch with every x seconds switch to another probe. The sensor is connected with arduino so arduino can provide a clock on one output. I believe that then I don\t need to have one dedicated Arduino input per probe. Just 1 input where frequency is read and one synchronization output. How to achieve it? Or is there a better way how to deal with it? ThanksTomas 
 I am trying to store temperature data in a variable so that I can use it for making a JSON object but the problem is that when I try to store the temperature in a variable it prints out the wrong value. I\m using a DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor and a library for calculating the temperature. Serial.printTemperature C: ;Serial.printlnfloatDHT11.temperature DEC;int temp1 = floatDHT11.temperature DEC;Serial.printlntemp1; These 4 lines is printing out this: Temperature C: 23.000000000010 The first one is correct but the second line should also be saying 23.I have tried only loading the data in once with the library as in outcommenting one line but that does not work.It\s like I have some syntax wrong but I can\t figure out what. 
 I have a atmel-328 with a xbee .I want to reduce the consumption of the battery. So I have kept the ardunio in sleep mode and it wakes up on a pre set time using jeelib laibrary.I have also kept the xbee in power down mode and wakes up when my arduno gets up with the intrupt from the jeelib library.Is there a bettery way to reduce the battery consumption ?Can I have a way that when I send a signal the form the server to the xbee; the xbee and the atmel-328 wakes up ? 
 Hello I was just wondering if anyone has successfully created a phonegap application that works with BLE to send Ardunio data to an iphone? 
 It\s about the RF24 library you can find here. http://maniacbug.github.io/RF24/index.html I transmit data from one Arduino to another using NRF24L01 radios.When I use the write-function on the transmitter arduino joystick is an array and after that I put in a delay higher then 10 the available function returns false. Transmitter radio.write joystick sizeofjoystick ;delay20; Receiver if!available print\No data\; // delay &gt; 10 --&gt; No data will be printed Why is it working with a delay of 10 but not above? Has it something to do with timeouts which is mentioned in the docs of the library?: http://maniacbug.github.io/RF24/classRF24.html#a4cd4c198a47704db20b6b5cf0731cd58 Thank you for your answers. 
 I was messing around with my arduino uno r3 and servo today. The book I got said to run the servo through the arduino. Everything was fine. I started changing the code and then things started to get bad. I noticed that if I did not put a delay in between the servo movements the board would freeze and I would have to get lucky. Well now I just cant communicate with the board. I plug the board in to my pc windows 7 makes the connection sound the board turns on the ON light the L light flashes then goes steady. In the arduino software the COM3 port which is where Im plugging it in is not coming up. Only COM1 is there. Im not sure what to do. The board is still functioning the servo moves. I tried to plug it in with a different port and with the servo disconnected but it still doesnt want to communicate with my pc. The code Im using is below #include &lt;Servo.h&gt;Servo servo1;void setup{ servo1.attach9;}void loop{ servo1.write50; delay500;
 Hello StackExchange community I have encountered a problem in my ECG/EKG design. I am trying to create the ECG using Arduino as a microcontroller to send/retrieve heart rate measurements via Bluetooth JY-MCU. I know my circuit is working because when I place an LED in op-amp output and its ground I get a slight dimming of the light if I gently put my hand on the leads. I know the issue is with my code. I have been working on this project for a while and still can\t be able to find a solution. Here is my schematic. Sorry you might want to flip your screen over to see the pic! Here is my code that I think is incorrect. The code is just at a bare minimum. // External variablesconst int signal = 8; // Pin connected to the filtered signal from the circuitunsigned long time; unsigned long frequency;char freq[3];// Internal variablesdouble period = 2000;double starttime = 2000;double in
 I am starting with Arduinos coming from the world of Linux with the RPi as a bridge and after having tested some setups I now wonder where to go next in implementation. What I am trying to understand is whether it is recommended time and cost-wise to create a standalone circuit-board based version of whatever I prototyped on the breadboard with a micro-controller with connections trimmed down to what is needed for that specific setup? or rather just look at neatly packaging the Arduiono with the breadboard and wires in a case? I expect to build 5 or 6 of the same simple setups to put in various places in my house. Note: there is a similar question with almost the same title but it deals with the legal aspects of commercializing a setup.

 I accidentally fried my Arduino. I found this Instructable. The symptoms are the same. The board not powering on connecting USB source and the over current protector was heating up. So i removed the voltage regulator as mentioned in the Instructable. But the problem is the pins 1 and 2 of where the regulator used to be are still shorted out. That is even after removing the regulator the pins seem to be somehow internally shorted. I tried checking the continuity on another working Arduino and found it to be not shorted. What seems to be the problem? 
 I keep reading how Arduinos are open source but my understanding of OSH is that all its components must be open source. Arduino uses an Atmel 8-bit CPU - but Googling this shows the Atmel is proprietary!? So I ask: how can Arduino be OSH if it\s chief component - its Atmel CPU - is proprietary?!?

 I have 3 arduinos that I want to program on all of them with their own cable and I have tried to connect them to my laptop on several different usb ports my usb ports work with mouses so thats unlikely to be the problem. However I just cannot connect to them they just dont appear under /dev/ttyACM* and the arduino IDE cannot find them either. Im running ubuntu 14.04 any suggestions for finding out what is likely to be wrong with my system or the arduinos? For some odd reason they now all appear to be seen as /dev/ttyACM* but they now all give me a avrdude: stk500_recv: programmer is not respondingavrdude: stk500_getsync attempt 10 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x00 error Anybody have any idea how to fix? The arduinos do not have any wires in them except usb nothing in reset or any other pin Im on ubuntu so the drivers shouldnt be an issue? And pin 13 flashes when I reset the arduino. 
 I want to send one bit of a byte out per rising edge received to an Arduino digital input. I am addressing the outputs using direct port manipulation to achieve maximum speed and I would like to do the same for input. So Im calling a function called bitBang in my main loop sending the ready line high before moving into the function: //Send controlPORTB |= _BVPORTB2;bitBangcontrolByte;PORTB &amp;= ~_BVPORTB2; What I would like to do upon entering the function is listen for a rising edge to appear on the digital input port using the direct port syntax and iterate through the byte setting the data line high or low depending on the bits value. How can I achieve this in the most efficient way possible? 
 I\m desperately trying to get my openlog to work and write data out to a micro SD card with no luck. I\m using a battery-powered lilypad arduino simple board and have attached L-shaped female headers to to the openlog to plug it right in. I am also using an FTDI breakout with the lilypad to download code and that is working. I think i have matched the RX and TX properly by flipping the openlog over as it pictured in the images attached. I\m using the example code included on the sparkfun openlog page just to test: https://github.com/sparkfun/OpenLog/blob/master/firmware/examples/OpenLog_Test_Sketch/OpenLog_Test_Sketch.ino There are no lights lit on the openlog which might indicate a power issue - but it\s super unclear. Any ideas or help very welcome! <img src=http://i.stack.imgur.com/QB15O.jpg alt=enter image des
 I was trying to make my arduino uno r3 to work on my Linux machine including the IDE but it wouldnt. At first I thought it was a software problem. Added myself to different groups and did everything people discussed on the forums. It didnt work. It wasnt recognized by the computer at all. I reinstalled. Nothing again. Thought it was a hardware problem of my computer. Tried with dads Windows 7 machine. Didnt work. Then I saw that the two leds TX and RX are not blinking neither are lit. I started doing a research on the internet but everybody suggests doing the loopback test from the IDE. My Arduino Uno R3 is not recognized by the computer therefore the IDE. Is there any way to check if its dead or if its a minor problem? Edit: I read a lot on the case last night and I reach to the conclusion that my ATmega16u2 the usb-serial chip Im sure it is 16u2 and not 8u2 its written on the chip itself might be dead. Tried to reflash the firmware but cannot get it in
 I tried to modify the example in the following page by replacing the given string with a 56 bytes one after making all the suitable changes to read write and max_payload_sizeincreased to 64 bytes payload_size parameters/methods in the RF24 library. http://shanes.net/another-nrf24l01-sketch-string-sendreceive/ The problem is the receiver truncates the string to 32 characters. Is 32 bytes a hard limitation for payload with the nrf24l01+ radio? If so how to I modify the receiver in above example problem to receive the entire string? 
 I want to transfer data from my smartphon to the Arduino by using the audio jack of my smartphone. For this I need verry high reading frequencys. I have used bitClearADCSRAADPS0; bitSetADCSRAADPS1; bitClearADCSRAADPS2; to boost analogread to ~10microseconds which would be enough. But somehow I am still wasting 5.4 ms at the beginning of the transmission. The only thing between signal start and first analogread is a start of a for loop: whileanalogReadA0&lt;50 true; //wait for start of transmissionfori = 0; i&lt;500;i++{data[i]=analogReadA0;} But does starting a for loop take 5.4 ms? Do you have any ideas?

 I was trying to interface my hex keypad with Arduino. I declared rows as input and columns as output. When I initialize three of the four columns as HIGH and one as LOW and detect the button pressed as LOW in the corresponding row it works fine. That is it detects the button when its corresponding row and column is LOW. But when I reverse the condition i.e. when I try to detect the button pressed when its corresponding row and column is high while others are low it does not work as expected. I really want to know why is this happening?

I burnt the bootloader into my new atmega328 using atmega8 arduino as described in the link above. Now can I replace my old atmega328 with this new bootloaded atmega328 to upload sketches to it? Or should I follow the steps described in the link to upload sketches?

 I would like to use a 555 circuit as an external watchdog for my Arduino project. The project is a cellular tracker that goes to sleep for an hour wakes up and does some measurements uploads them and then goes to sleep again. The 555 should take care that the active period does not take too long because the systems hangs and in that case trigger a reset. My first thought was to power the 555 circuit with a PIN of the Arduino so that it only goes on when the system is awake and is turned off while sleeping. But this does not work as the reset line has to stay high even while sleeping and if i turn the 555 off reset would also go low. Could a Mosfet help? Any other ideas?

 From what I understand the Pro Trinket has Optiboot which allows it to detect which boot loader you are trying to use one for USB and one for FTDI. When it\s in this bootloader state the red LED on pin 13 buses for 10 seconds before it starts to run the program I\ve programmed. Can I remove this Optiboot functionality? Would that entail permanently choosing a single boot loader/interface? One problem I have with this is that along with the LED on 13 it causes the LED strip I have attached to pins 9 10 11 to blink. I would also really like to not have to wait 10 seconds to start running code. Here\s the page on Adafruit\s site that talks about the bootloader[s] on the Pro Trinket . Thanks!

 I just received my first Arduino board which is essentially a Leonardo ATmega32U4 customized to include a NFC reader PN532. When I plug it in the PWR LED comes on steady the D13 LED flashes a few times and then the STA LED blinks once and only the PWR LED is left on. I can upload a basic sketch to the correct Serial Port but the Serial Monitor is always empty. I have noticed that when uploading the sketch the RX/TX LEDs stay off which I thought was a sign of uploading/downloading data. I figured this was the root of my issue so I tried to look into it further. Running lsusb does not find the device and dmesg does not show any information when unplugging the device. I also tried on a Windows install but couldn\t install the Leonardo drivers since Device Manager wouldn\t register any unknown USB/Arduino devices. Do you think my board i
 I\m trying to use 3 pins as capacitive pins along side the Mozzi . I had several attempts and so far the closest I had was using code from the ADCTouch library straight into the main code but with the current implementation removing averaging and taking less samples to speed things up it\s only fast enough to process 1 pin and I\d like to use 3. Here is my implementation so far: /* Based on the Gain Example changing the gain of a sinewave using Mozzi sonification library.

 It appears to me that each Arduino has should have? a unique /dev/tty...USB... number assigned. Why this isnt explained anywhere that I can find is a mystery. When I plug my problem Nano into a USB port on my iMac no /dev/tty... for it appears. It used to work. Have I fried it? Can this be fixed? 
 I am thinking about building a circuit that is literally going to take 11 of the 14 digital pins of an UNO to communicate with an SD card and an external EEPROM chip EEPROM programmer. Using 4 shift registers and the SD card I will have 1 digital pin left. Well Im also reserving pins 0/1 for serial communication. Anyway I need to read some external buttons and I have the 6 analog pins that I havent touched. I will only need about 4-5 push buttons in my design so they should fit nicely on A0+. So my question is will I run into any issues doing this? Or are the analog inputs better left for true analog reading? Thanks. 
 I am using Arduino IDE to program my Atmegas with bootloaders. I can directly manipulate ports use timers interrupts pwm pin and timers and etc. Everything is working. But this question rises: Does this IDE differ from AVR Studio in terms of using C or C++ on an Atmega chip? I know AVR Studio has some features or something. My question is not about that. My question is that I am coding everything not using extra librariesfeatures etc.

 I am currently working on reading pressure values using a tekscan a201 sensor. The sensors I have are limited to 25lbs. My plan is to use eight on these sensors of them with a arduino Mega. Since I am measuring the resistance I am thinking of making a 8 similar voltage divider circuits and grabbing the voltage reading via arduinos analog pins. At the moment I am not sure how to convert these readings to engineering units. Any ideas? 
 I am designing a board for my electronics project and i am using a number of ATTiny85 for it. The ATTinys will be SMD so i will not be able to remove them for programming. Moreover all of the pins of my uCs will be used for connections apart from reset. Is it possible in this case to achieve that any ideas and suggestions are welcome EDIT: Well Vcc and Ground will be common i will be using an external oscillator for all of them the reset pin will be free the other three pins will be used for gpio communication between the attinys.I am connecting about 10 attiny in a daisy chain kind of thing

Now since I need to check quite a few conditions Id like to know if the following is the same or if all conditions will be evaluated prior to making a decision? ifvariable &amp;&amp; register &amp;&amp; read_peripheral { // [do something]} 
 I bought a HC-06 Module for my Arduino Uno the other day yesterday it arrived and I\m having trouble using it with the Arduino IDE. I set it up connecting 5V GND and RX/TX crossed. After a bit of searching it shows up on the bluetooth settings on the macbook. When I click connect it fails after I click Options then set the Pin to 1234 it says Connected. The LED on the HC-06 is still blinking which is OK I guess since I\m not yet communicating. I have a Sketch running on the Uno that prints out some text. When I open the serial monitor after connecting like above it works displaying the values I expect. However after closing the serial monitor the HC-06 changes to not connected on the mac. Also if I try to upload code via the Arduino IDE it states: avrdude: ser_open: can\t open device /dev/tty.HC-06-DevB: Resource busyioctlTIOCMGET: Inappropriate ioctl for device or throws a processing.app.SerialException: Fehler bei
 Id like to use an Arduino Yn in a somewhat outdoor environment in a metal box on a truck. I think Ive seen that the temperature requirements of the Uno are -40 C to +85 C but I cant find that information about the Yn. It would be nice to know where to find information about the temperature and humidity safe working requirements for every Arduino model. 
 if I solder the jumper pads on the adafruit cc3000 for use with the Arduino Mega will it still work fine with the Uno? 
 I am looking for the source and/or proper definition for the int function.I have searched through the source in Arduino.app without much success. The reference gives a terse explanation intx x: a value of any type Converts a value to the int data type Passing 1 1 or 49 returns the int 1. I havent tested other types. This seems to be an Arduino specific function - it doesnt seem to be in any c/c++ library.

 Situation: Mac OS Arduino IDE 1.5.6r2 Ive got a sketch with several files all classic .cpp and .h source and header files except the main sketch file. As the project goes more complex I started to generate code automatically by another program. Now I have hard times integrating the generated code it into my sketch. The arduino IDE seems to load the code on opening the sketch. After that the source files arent beeing checked for external changes by the IDE as I would expect it from a real editor like vim . On top of that when I verify my code the IDE seems to save the files from RAM into a temporary build directory ignoring the contents of the sketch directory further. So if I let my code generator change a source file while the sketch is opened in the IDE the changes wont reach the build. I had to close the IDE and reopen it. The next thing I tried is to include my autogenerated file from an existing and opened code file inside the IDE. But the IDE igno
 I downloaded the RTClib library from https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib . In every provided example #include &lt;Wire.h&gt; is written immediately above #include RTClib.h at the top of the sketch. Why is this necessary? I know the RTClib library requires the functionality of the Wire library but if this is the case why can\t I just #include &lt;Wire.h&gt; at the top of RTClib.h? I have tried the latter even using just the following sketch but my sketch failed to compile. RTClib.h: // Code by JeeLabs http://news.jeelabs.org/code/// Released to the public domain!

 I\m developing a low power project based on Atmega328p which among other things uses a DHT22 to measure air humidity. DHT22 spec says that it consumes 50uA when idle. This is too high for me I\m aiming at sub 10uA consumption for the whole device when in sleep mode so I\ve figured out that I\ll just power it from one of Atmega328p pins. This will give me the ability to turn it off or on at software level. DHT22 consumes only 1.5mA during measurement so I should be fine a single Atmega\s pin can safely provide up to 20mA. I\ve set up a following test circuit: The red wire powers DHT22 the blue one is for data transfer the black one is GND and the 4.7k is a pull-up resistor. My problem is that after I turn on the DHT22 using just: digitalWrite4 HIGH; the Atmega either resets or hangs or... successfully turns on the DHT22 and keeps working but that happens about 10% of th
 Please can anyone help me with this puzzle? Ive 4 amperes drained by the Stepstick A4988 immediately at power on of 12V also when motor is disconnected. The trimmer that should regulate max output current seems to have no effect: always 4 amperes are drained from power supply in whatever way it is set. I tried different brand new A4988 but they show the same behaviour: the chip and the 100 microF condenser connected in parallel to 12v overheat in a few seconds obviously! I checked multiple times wiring and its ok checking with multiple sites online. Could anyone help me to fix the problem?Thanks in advance. 
 I generally use sockets for AVRs in standalone circuits but sometimes I sell my items and therefore I soldier the chip on the circuit. As you guess I can upgrade the code inside the chip with socket simply putting the chip out and putting it into the programmer board but It doesnt work the same way with the ones which are soldiered on the circuit. I know there are some ISP devices like USBtinyISP etc. but I want to be more professional and know exactly how an in system programmer work. Do I have to use Avrdude If I design my own In system programmer? Isnt there any way that is more universal? I searched the internet for a long time and I found only hobbyist stuff. Can anyone explain or simply direct me to a good source that explains this topic? Thank you in advance. 
 I want to design an Arduino shield with stackable headers so it will allow other shields to be mounted on top of it. I was wondering if these could be soldered automatically. Neither wave nor reflow soldering seems to be an option. Wave soldering would leave solder on the pins so they won\t fit in sockets and for reflow pin-in-paste the long pins will completely pull the paste from the holes. Is hand-soldering the only way making the board more expensive or is there still another way? Would it be a good idea to supply the shield with the headers not mounted to save cost?Or shouldn\t I assume the average Arduino user has a soldering iron? 
 Im in the process of buying a receiver and transmitter for my quad copter project. Would it be possible to use this receiver or a similar one to control the quad. Im trying to read the signals using Pulse in. Im inexperienced in RC and I only found one tutorial on how to do this. I know that the receiver will have to be wired up to the analog pins on the arduino however the receiver has an operating voltage of 3.5V-10V and an operating current of 100mA which exceeds the 40mA of the arduino board. I have seen videos of people using silar 2.4Ghz receivers on arduino Nanos without problems. Has anyone on this board done something similar and if so can thou guide me? 
 I\m working on a project with 4 inputs and 7 possible outputs on an Arduino Uno. Based on any combination of those inputs I need to run a specific loop that will repeat until there is a change in ANY of the 4 inputs. Specifically: Input 1 = loop 1 Input 2 = loop 2 Input 3 = loop 3 Input 4 = loop 4 Input 2 and 3 = loop 5 Input 2 and 4 = loop 6 No input = do nothing So I need to constantly read the 4 inputs and change output loops accordingly. I have basic Arduino knowledge but am stumped. This is what I\ve tried - I have 4 input pins and 8 output pins int outPin = 0;int inPin = 0;int CAR = 0;int pinRead = 0;void setup{ for int outPin = 3; outPin &lt; 11; outPin++; { //set pins 3 thru 10 as OUTPUT pinModeoutPin OUTPUT; } for int inPin = 9; inPin &lt; 13; inPin++; { //set pins 9 thru 12 as INPUT pinModeinPin INPUT; }}void loop{ for int CAR = 3; CAR &lt;11; CAR++
 I\m currently working on a project that requires to display images on a touchscreen on my arduino. These images are neither stored in arduino nor any memory card. I want to be able to send the images via Bluetooth from an app and display it on the touchscreen. The problem is I couldn\t find a good and solid Bluetooth shield or module that provide file transfer via bluetooth from an iOS app to arduino. If you can name a few bluetooh shields or modules that\d be great. In the thread below someone claimed hc-05 works. Can anyone support that claim? Thanks. http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=208306.0 
 I am trying to build a robot which needs motors to roll around. So I was trying to control two DC motors with H-Bridge that comes with Arduino StarterKitH-bridge motor driver [L293D]. I used Sketch that looks something like that I did read that Arduino needs separate powering but i did not use any only USB connection. I connected 5V that comes from arduino to where + pin from battery should have been connected and motors were controlled and working.However when i tried using 9V battery and connecting it as seen on above picture H-bridge did not control mototrs and nothing was working.There is also another aspect - when robot was touching the surface then wheels did not move aka motors did not rotate and when you picked it up motors accelerated to quite some speed. Also when robot was on the surface and connected via USB the PC made these USB connecting sounds repeatedly.I am not sure when R
 I\m have a Sleepy Pi and am having extreme difficulties trying to program a wake/sleep cycle. Sleepy Pi is an Arduino board with a RTC. My ultimate goal is for a time-lapse project.

I would like the Sleepy Pi to wake at 8am 9am 10am ... 3pm 4pm and 5pm each for 5 minutes then go back to sleep. I\ve been working with the SleepyPi Time TimeAlarms LowPower and DS1374RTC 
 I am new to all of this so anything is helpful. 
 I bought one of these : There are 3 pins on it: 5V GND OUT My guess is that OUT is an analogue signal that I can measure with my Arduino am I right? I am using the Analogue Output example code but I just get 5V all the time it does not seems to change with the sound levels. Am I doing something wrong? What am I adjusting with the blue square on the board? Should I maybe do that?

 Without asking an open-ended question i wish to find the best way resourcefulness to execute methods from an arduino based on time. in a nutshell every 10 minutes i want functionA to be called &amp; every 30 minutes functionB. At this point im unable to specifiy whether a method would need to be called at a less frequent rate however i wish to assume that one may. My 2 ideas so far: encapsulate the functions a &amp; b inside the NTP client and execute based on the minutes in an hour or use delay or even the milli counter with functions a &amp; b below inside the loop. My main worry of the 2nd option is that the arduino handles time keeping itself in a long run lets say 1 year the arduino will end up with no memory left. Whats is the consensus with this? Board wise to be run on Uno &amp; Mega.

 I bought a SainSmart Arduino Mega 2560. I uploaded a small sketch to it and it uploaded fine. When I upload a larger sketch though I get this error: verification error first mismatch at byte 0x3895 0xdf != 0x44 So obviously theres nothing wrong with my bootloader because I can upload smaller files. Why is this happening? 
 I am currently working on a quadcopter in which I want help in setting up my PID. I am trying to get output from the PID loop by giving input from MPU6050s accelerometer and gyro pitch value. The pitch value from the MPU6050 is given to PID loop but I am not getting any output from the loop. I have set the setpoint as 0 and the output from the MPU6050 ranges between -90 to +90this is the PID input. My code for PID: float input output setpoint=0;PID* myPID&amp;input &amp;output &amp;setpoint 2 5 1 REVERSE; myPID.compute; Then I am printing the output values but am getting only 0 whatever the input from MPU6050. 
 I wanted to know if the reference voltage for the digitalRead function could be set to a particular voltage either with an external reference or internally. In the Arduino reference under the constants heading they have mentioned that they use 3V as reference for the boards Im using an Arduino Uno R3. But I want to change it to be a little lower. Is it possible and if so how? 
 i would like to generate Chirp Signal Frequency Sweep using Arduino. i have searched a lot in internet but didnt find anything. Basically any parameters is also ok.

 Im updateing my Arduino Wifi shield with firmware 1.0.2 found in Arduino IDE 1.0.6. Is there any newer firmware out there? 
 I came across something strange while reading the datasheet for the microcontroller in the Arduino Uno board. It is the 8 note in pg.296-297 of this datasheet : what does WORDS mean in that context? 
 I got a bit confused by Sparkfun\s hookup guide for this 9DoF breakout module. It says the VDD-in on the breakout should [get voltage] regulated between 2.4V and 3.6V yet in their example they do not hook it up to the Arduino\s 3.3V pin but instead they use the 5V and a bi-directional logic level converter. Do I need to use the logic level converter or can I just hook the module up to the 3.3V pin of my Arduino Uno without damaging the breakout module? 
 Trying to make my zumo robot stay within a track made of electrical tape. Basically when the right or left sensor detects the tape sensors > sensor threshold after going from grey surface to black it needs to turn the other way. If neither outer sensor detects the tape it should go in a straight line with slightly increased speed. My attempts thus far usually has the right side detecting the tape but not the left side. Honestly Im not sure why/if the very small delays are needed.

 Im still new to Arduino and I need some help. I put a photo sensor so that if the sensor detects light my LED lights stay off but if no light is detected my LEDs turn off depending on the voltage. So basically if I have a voltage less than the threshold I have assigned my LEDs turn on but if I have the same or more my LEDs turn off. I assigned 2.5 volts but my LEDs stayed on so I begun assigning smaller voltage threshold but I reached 0.5 volts and my lights are still on! Whats happening?

 I have the RC522 RFID read/write module and would like to use it with arduino? Im puzzled at the moment which one to choose in order not to deal with voltage supply for RC522 because RFID module requires 3.3V. And to be frankly I wouldnt like to take extra voltage converters 5V to 3.3V or vs while connecting RFID module to above aforementioned options. What can you advice? Thanks beforehand! P.S.The form factor plays the significant role in my project so that I prefer little arduino board to other versions like UNO MEGA and etc.

 I wish to use a MOSFET to drive a 12V rated LED strip from an Arduino.

The load must be between my mosfet and my car battery GND .

 I have many Arduino Mini Pro every from different seller.Few are 3.3v and most 5v. I had to clean table for Xmas and now I do not have any idea how to identify 3.3v Arduinos.

 I want to output a chosen sound e.g a singer singing a D or E or F note which I have recorded. I can change the filetype to whatever is neccessary e.g mp3 or whatever. The recording could be 10ms or longer if that helps. I want to be able to switch between notes quickly ideally 1ms delay is this possible? I read about using a WTV020-SD Mini but this has a gap of 20ms between tunes sadly. At the very least I dont want a 20ms noiseless gap as it switches between one note to the next. If it plays the old noise that would be ok but ideally id like it to be able to switch between the notes in a millisecond or so. What is the best way to accomplish this? Ideally the solution would be narrow to fit in a 10mm radius cylinder up to 100mm in length although ideally smaller. 
 Is there a way to program the Ethernet Shield and Uno R3 to act as a firewall without using a huge chunk of the allowed bytes on the R3?

 Im doing a schematic for an arduino project-based and I can not proceed. Im facing a problem which I have no idea how can I solve it so thats the reason Im writing back to you. The thing is: I have three atmega 328 and I want to program them using a single ftdi or a USB-UART converter. I can not put the chip outside the board and program them one by one so the ftdi should be in the PCB.I was wondering if I can do it using a switch with three positions with the help of 3 MOSFETs but I found it impossible is it? Do you have any idea how can I solve this clue? Many Thanks!

I have an ATmega328 on it so it should allow me to write up to 1Kb on it however Ive tried the Eeprom write command and it does not seem to write to more than 100 locations on it the first 100 bytes! I am using the Eepromex library. Any thoughts on whats causing this? Edit: These are the excerpts from my code related to Eeprom logging: int addr1 = 0;int addr2 = 256; // Store Data in EEPROM EEPROM.writeaddr1FinalMoisture[0]; delay5; EEPROM.writeaddr2FinalMoisture[1]; delay5; // advance index pointer to the next location. There are 256 bytes assigned for each sensor in the EEPROM so go back to 0 when we hit 255/511. addr1 = addr1 + 1; if addr1 == 255 addr1 = 0; //same for addr 2 : addr2 = addr2 + 1; if addr2 == 511 addr2 = 256; // delay until next measurement msec Sleepy::loseSomeTime30000; PS: As mentioned ear
 I didnt see any content on this on this forum so I thought I would ask about everyones experience. I am working on an outdoor project. The project will be about 80 feet from the back of my house. My house is brick. Its been too cold so far this year to walk out there and see if my wifi reaches. But lets just assume that it does. If it doesnt then that answers my question but if it does...in your experience is it better to go with the wifi on the arduino yun or to get the POE header and go that route instead? 
 Compilation of even the simplest program like Blink is extremely slow the progress bar often hangs halfway for nearly half a minute. Is this normal? I understand that not all computers are equally fast but there\s a huge difference between 3 seconds and 30 seconds edit It appears from the report that every time I switch programs they\re built anew completely: Build options changed rebuilding all even when nothing has been changed. How can I avoid a complete rebuild? 
 Are there Arduino UNO R3s which use a crystal instead of a ceramic resonator? Frankly I dont understand this cheapness: if you really want to save on component cost you can run both AVRs on the same crystal. The 16U2 always has a crystal. 
 I am experiencing a problem when programming Arduino Micro in OSX Mavericks. I have tried to reproduce this problem in XCode and Arduino IDE and it is persistent.

 I am developing a product and to ease my job i am planning to use MCU inside the arduino with the library of Arduino. Since all the registers are already defined inside the library and all required things to registers of corresponding MCU are done to make a pin input/output enable interrupt enable UART enable I2C. I think that i can directly use the arduino coding enviroment even if i use MCU seperately. Is it possible and how? can i use it in commertial product i have already prototyped it with arduino 
 Im intending to set up a digital delay using a circular buffer in SRAM with an Arduino Due @84MHz. The lenth of the buffer determines the delay. I need about 1us resolution and the delay needs to be dynamically settable between 0 - 500us. Ill probably use most of the memory just for the buffer. Ive got a very basic setup going with a fixed delay no buffer that just updates a temporary variable with the current state of the input signal and then writes the whole word to another port in order to set the state. Next up is designing the buffer so I can add some delay to the output of the signal. Filling the buffer using interrupts watching signals on the same port shouldnt be too difficult but I am wondering: a taking speed in consideration which buffer method will have the least processing overhead? Memory stack or an array[] or someting else? b is there a way to read a port and set an output port in one clock cycle? I am now using RE
 I have already prototyped my product and i want to use arduino library in my printed circuit which includes ATmega32u4 the MCU in arduino leonardo. Can i use the library? if i can how? i know the registers etc. and used c8051f320 and coded in this way. But i dont want to run all over the datasheets etc. use this freely available and legal library 
 so I\m using a promini running on solar power. For some reason after sometime it gets stuck with the green led flashing and only by cutting power can I reset the promini. Even the reset button doesnt work. Exactly like in this post Watchdog timer stuck in restart loop? green led flashing . However the strange thing is that I am not even using a watchdog timer. So what could be the cause of it? Could it be due to the lack of power from my solar panel?

 I want my Attiny85 to communicate with another attiny85.one attiny should send a message to my other attiny. When he receives the correct message he should turn one led on. Just a very simple test scatch.I dont know why but the led never turns on. Here is my code: 1st attiny85: int clk_pin = 4 data_pin = 3 led = 0;void setup { pinModeclk_pin INPUT; pinModedata_pin INPUT; pinModeled OUTPUT;}void loop { byte incoming = shiftIndata_pin clk_pin LSBFIRST; if incoming == 2 { digitalWriteled HIGH; delay1000; digitalWriteled LOW; delay1000; }} 2nd attiny: int clk_pin = 0 data_pin = 1;void setup{ pinModeclk_pin OUTPUT; pinModedata_pin OUTPUT;}void loop{ byte test = 2; shiftOutdata_pin clk_pin LSBFIRST test; delay5000;} I think there might be something wrong with my shiftIn/shiftOut command. Its actually the first time Im using this.

 I am trying to measure a users \hand steadiness\ in order to control a video game character in UNITY3D. I am using a MinIMU-9 Gyro/Accelerometer/Compass linked with Arduino. I can measure pitch/roll etc in Arduino...and I have passed previous Arduino measurements into Unity via the serial command but I am l trying to do two things:1. simplify &amp; reduce noise in the data coming from the magnetometer reading before I pass it into Unity by taking an average of every 10 magnetometer readings.2. Combining the three magnetometer values to get one overall variable or measurement that can be passed into unity.

 I came across a dev board around the Atmel Xmega controller. This an AVR like used on Arduino but with a lot of extras. I was surprised to see that the board is hardly more expensive than an Arduino despite: 384kB of Flash versus 32kB for Arduino DMA Xmega can run at 32 MHz 16 MHz for Arduino on-board OLED display on-board light and temperature sensors on-board microSD socket For all these on-board features you\d need a shield or breakout board for Arduino. I seems to me that for a lower price than Arduino you could build a much more powerful system which is Arduino-compatible. How hard would it be to port Arduino to the Xmega? see also http://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-71436 <
 I am looking to buy a range finder module for an obstacle avoidance robot. Currently two good options based on available libraries and compatibility with Arduino and rPI are HC-SR04 and parallax ping. In terms of form factor these seem the same. The only difference I can tell is 4 pins vs 3 pins. Also the price with parallax being more than x4 the price. As I would rather not buy something cheaper which will need replacing is anyone aware of further differences that will make the parallax a better option? both need 5Vboth have max range of 3-4mSensor angle HC- 15 degrees parallax cant find..

 Im wanting to upload a v short piece of music to an arduino nano and then play it repeatedly. The file length only needs to be 10ms how do I do this? Im unsure what format to put it in where to put it in the code and also the size limits Is it 2kb RAM size or 32kb EEPROM size that will decide how big a file I can put in? I dont know how/where to put the code and how to get it to play. I found lots of information on running it off SD cards or other external memory but these arent an option at the moment as I am limited to what I currently have currently - an arduino nano a load of resistors diodes and thats about it Im just wiring the speaker directly between pin4 and ground but could do more wiring if thats required. Im quite happy to reduce the sample rate of the file down to get it small enough to fit the 2kb or 32kb size - but I have no idea what to to/where to paste the code/even where to get the code from a .wav or .mp3 or whatever file

 I\m using an arduino uno r3 board. I am attempting to make an LED light up using a capacitor. My approach :I am attempting to connect a switch capacitor and LED in series. My assumption is that when i press the switch the capacitor will start charging. AFter i release the switch i expect the LED to light up for some brief amount of time. Whats happening :As soon as i click on th switch and LED lights up for an instance and goes off. However after holding the switch for approx 10-15 secs i let it go the LED doesn\t light up. Below is what the circuit looks like. Any feedback on my approach circuit or on whats happening? 
 From what i\ve researched here is my thoughts on both C++I heard that you can create libraries using C++ in arduino. And you can use the Arduino IDE to do that stuff. Here is the proof http://arduino.cc/en/Hacking/LibraryTutorial Notice that it uses the C++ syntax. I also see arduino projects on github written on C++ https://github.com/search?l=C%2B%2B&amp;q=Arduino&amp;type=Repositories&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93 C I heard that you can use AVR GCC and code it without the arduino ide. And I heard it\s much faster than the arduino language because it\s more closer to the metal. But I think it\s harder to set up because you need a programmer into the Atmel chip which is much more costlier compared to directly plugging in the arduino u

 i need to read data from a motors encoder from arduino uno with simulink.Is this possible ?If yes can you explain how? 
 There is a function on one of my programs I want to be switch on and off by pressing a button. The button is unbiased otherwise I would set the function to read the button\s status of HIGH or LOW. So I need to create variable named switch with an initial value of 0. Then I would create a function would read if buttonPin is HIGH change the value of switch by +1. Next time the buttonPin is HIGH change the value by -1 so that every time the button is pressed the value of switch alternates between 1 and 0. Now before my loop calls the function I want on or off it can compare the value of switch and run or not run the function. I don\t know how to express this in the Arduino sketch. I\m am also open to alternate ways of achieving the same result.

 I\m new to Arduino/C development coming from a JavaScript/Ruby environment but I was wondering if it was possible to include a library from a custom folder within a sketch?

I\ve tried several variations on this; # project.ino#include &lt;libs/MyNewLib/MyNewLib.h&gt;#include libs/MyNewLib/MyNewLib.h#include &lt;./libs/MyNewLib/MyNewLib.h&gt;#include ./libs/MyNewLib/MyNewLib.h But not of them works. Can anyone tell me or this is possible? I\ve looked into this question around the web but I can\t find any satisfying answer. Hopefully you guys can help. Cheers. UPDATE I\m aware you can put your libraries in your global libraries folder but I want them in my local project folder. I want to share them through git with my team. 
 I am having an issue with removing temporarily files I am creating under the /www directory. I have a subdir /www/csv where csv formatted files are being written based on sensor data. The files are created on-demand on the YUN placed in the /www/csv dir with the whole process driven by a REST call and an AJAX implementation in a browser. The files are created with no problem with a Filesystem.openpath FILE_WRITE; call. I can also use the Process calls from the bridge library to rename the file after it is full written. However if I try to use Process calls i.e. p.beginrm; etc etc to remove the files after use the files are never deleted. I also tried the mv the files to /tmp so they would get cleaned up by the OS eventually but that fails also. I have the rights to /www and /www/csv set to 777. I am assuming this is an access rights issue however I am unsure what user my REST calls are running as it would be whatever the default is for a YUN as I have cre

 I am really new to Arduino so please bear with me. I am running an Arduino Uno with several sensors to capture some data related to a fish tank. Here is basically what it does: Capture data light temperature etc. Display data on an LCD screen when a button is pressed Upload data to thingspeak every 5 minutes using a ESP8266 Feed the fish every 4 hours through a servo An RGB led blinks at various colors to let me see whats happening e.g. red when connecting to wifi. Everything is working reasonably well. That being said my code is super messy and I am not sure I have the right approach. With the code I have: - Nothing can be done while the Arduino uploads the wifi - Nothing can be done when the fish are fed. This is not so much about the servo it is more about the wifi problem. How would you suggest that I rewrite my code so that 1 I can run the wifi more than once every 5 minutes and 2 it does not bloc

 I would like the sensor values to be updated each 10ms100Hz and then run the algorithm and repeat the same process. However after timing the algorithm it is taking only 2ms I think the data_ready interrupt is not working as expected. Physical hardware connection is from INT1 of ADXL345 to pin2 of the UNO. edit: I have configured the accelerometer to have a data rate of 100Hz. I have set up an interrupt with data_ready to run the algorithm present in the loop each time a new sample comes that is each 10ms. However each sample is coming every 2ms which shows the interrupt is not working and I would like to know why. I have timed the interrupt with the millis; function before and after calling the interrupt also I have stored the samples in an array and printed it on the serial interface and the samples were repeated as it was updated every 2ms instead of 10ms. The algorithm I have developed needs the sampling rate to be 100Hz. #include &lt;Wire.h&gt;#i

Is it possible or would I damage my board when connecting USB wireq to RX / TX pins on my Arduino?

I can not understand what is wrong. Thanks a lo
 I have a Uno third party that I connect to my Dell laptop with no problems at all. But Ive just received a Nano also third party that I just cant get to upload. After lots of interneting I hit Windows normally-useless troubleshooting tool. That tells me that the USB device the Nano doesnt understand USB3 and I should plug it into a USB2 port. Unfortunately being a new machine there IS no USB2 port. Is Windows Troubleshooting lying? Is there a problem interfacing with a Nano via USB3? Edit: Error message is: stk500_recv: programmer is not responding 
 I have one raspberry pi B+ and an Arduino uno. I know how to control a relay from an Arduino. I searched a tutorial about voice recognition on arduino but got to know that arduino cannot take in audio inputs. It can just sense if there is an audio. Now I think that I can use the raspberry pi to take inputs and convert it to text with software and then send it to arduino. Then Arduino can control the relay. Is there any way to do that? 
 I want to interface a GLCD with arduino uno. The GLCD is JHD12864E. The connections are as shown in this image I downloaded the OpenGLCD library and uploaded HelloWorld program from it.I got the error: stk500_recv : programmer is not responding Then I googled it and also tried to upload using ISP using another arduino. The program uploaded successfully but i did not get any output on GLCD. I am not getting this error when uploading any other sketches. Can anyone explain to me why do we get this error? And what is the solution to it?

 My question isnt specific to Arduino but can concern Raspberry Pi and all Internet of Things homemake projects. As Im preparing a personal projet with sensors data storage and visualisation/reporting web page not yet Android app Im looking about Internet of Things platform. It seems all that I can find are cloud related system. I would prefer a home localized solution but Im not able to find one and maybe open source where datas dont go outside home. The goal is to be able to : send datas from my Arduino to a home storage server store these data into database for later query may be MySql trigger some computation or aggregation job over datas prepare some graphs generate some html page from template option: allow Android client to connect and get datas/graphs Before starting thinking how to create my own non standardized system is anyone can give me some advice ? some name of
 Are there any Arduino-like board designs that are NOT using an AVR chip but perhaps a chip like the Z80 or the 6502? 
 are there any USB to TTL with switchable 5v and 3.3v i need to use it for raspberry pi and arduino 
 Im working on a custom arduino that will run at 3.3 V with no regulators or USB chips for power consumption. Ive heard that overclocking the chip at 16 MHz/3.3 V is generally fine but Id like to stay within spec anyway. First: to run at 8 MHz do I just need to replace the crystal? Or is there anything else I have to do? Second: Do I need to make any code changes to reflect the new speed? Im using serial SPI and I2C connections in this project along with the NilRTOS operating system and millis/delay functions. Will any of these be broken? Will the code run noticeably slower? Third: How can I program the chip? Is it ok to program it in an Arduino Uno at 16 MHz then transplant it to the custom arduino? Fourth: Will power consumption change at 8 MHz? Thanks! 
 I have installed an MFRC522 RFID reader in my house. The main use so far is to tell the house I\ve arrived using an RFID keychain by leaving it in the key holder. I would also like for the house to detect when I\m gone and I was thinking that if I can detect when a tag is present I should also be able to detect when it is not. However this poses some challenges like the following: Should I be constantly reading the tag until it disappears from range? when I take it from the key holder. What if I have more than one RFID Keychain/Tag in the range of the reader? because there could be other keychains in the same key holder. Would I get multiple readings or could one tag interfere with another in some way? I realize that maybe this is not the typical RFID scenario when the tag is scanned and then moved away from the reader. I\ve been searching about RFID tag absence
 I am looking at the following code and getting confused by a few elements in it: 1 Why is there a writeto function being performed to the memory locations x0530x31x09 for accelerometer and 0x680x16 and 0x1A for gyro?

 I\m trying to use Adafruit\s LED Backpack library within a custom class. When I use the Adafruit library directly within a sketch it compiles fine. When I use an example sketch provided with the library it compiles fine. However when I create an instance of my custom class with the Adafruit object within it I get the following error: In file included from sketch_feb18a.ino:6: /Users/lawnmowerlatte/Documents/Arduino/libraries/Bargraph/bargraph.h:18: error: \Adafruit_24bargraph\ does not name a type All the reasons I\ve seen for this error stem from the library being missing or otherwise incorrectly installed. However since I can use it directly I think something else must be wrong.

 I am planning to build a calculator using Arduino as the base. I already know C and I love low-level stuff so I guess the software part wont be a problem. However Ive been stuck with Arduino. What I need is something capable of doing math as Im not even sure if Arduino has a FPU and it to have enough inputs for more than the basic 0-9 + - / * keys. I am a real newbie when it comes to hardware. I dont even have the slightest clue where to start. I barely understand Arduinos specifications which is why Im asking here. I want to do something more than the classic calculator because the software part is not a problem. I just need help on which hardware should I choose; both on the which Arduino and which accesories for the Arduino parts. P.S. I have some experience with x86 assembly; does that mean that 86duino or Intel Galileo are better for me? 
 I am trying to do some experiments with conductive sheet velostat. When I apply a force on the sheet it should change the value of resistanceoutput. I taking the output of the sheet by connecting to analog input Ao of Arduino. But I am not getting constant readings from arduino even if no pressure is applied. Do I need to build any extra circuitry to stabilize the output value? Can anyone please tell how to stabilize the output value of Arduino? 
 I have an Arduino Yn running Openwrt-Yn 1.5.3 which is the latest version as I upgraded yesterday and I am trying to obtain a .hex compiled sketch so that I can upload a sketch directly into the Yn. I know about compiled sketches but there are no build directories in C:\\Documents and Settings\\MY_USERNAME\\Local Settings\\Temp. Where can I obtain the .hex of any file I have compiled and how? 
 i don\t have any sources or code from google to connect it with arduino. I am totally stuck with it. at first i work with only base plate there was no module so i cant connect. But now i know what is base and complete Bluetooth module by comparing two pictures. And now it is working. :D 
 Do you know an IDE that is Arduino compatible with : Black background white hurts my eyes Some auto completion features mabe ? And also one which lets you minimise brackets Xcode like. A better console... Somthing to clear the serial console? A bread board view something fancy !

 I\m working on a project that uses an Arduino Uno to listen for a bell ring and then uploads to a web server the exact time the bell was rung using a WiFi Shield. I want to know how I can listen for the bell ring a three second long high pitch tone and be able to detect that that\s what the Arduino heard. I think the best way may be to pre-record the sound and then the Arduino will constantly try to match the incoming sounds to the prerecorded sound. I\m wondering how I could go about doing this or are there better methods. The bell sounds kind of like this: bell sound 
 Id like to use Timer1 to measure the time between rising edges of two input signals. Specifically use Tn to start the timer counter and IPCn to latch the elapsed time since the rising edge of the Tn input signal. The goal is to measure the time between the rising edges of two input signals. Is there a Timer1 library out there that alread does this? Code suggestions welcomed. 
 I\m attempting to drive 300 TM1803 RGB LEDs from an Arduino Uno using the FastLED library. My code works fine for 100 LEDs but when I go to 150 the arrays that store LED values and my sensor data get corrupted causing the LEDs to flash colors randomly every few seconds. From what I\ve read these are exactly the symptoms of running out of RAM leading to something overwriting the RAM that contains my arrays. However with 150 LEDs the MemoryFree library says I\m only using 920 bytes of RAM no matter where in my code I measure and the IDE says 880. Does anybody know what\s going on? Is there something using 1100 bytes of RAM for a very short amount of time so that I can\t measure it? My code: #include FastLED.h#include &lt;MemoryFree.h&gt;const byte ledsPin = 3;const byte sensorPin = A1;const int numLeds = 300;const int ledTime = 1000;const int sensorMin = 0;const int sensorMax = 512;const CRGB correction = CRGB8025570; // Cool white//const CRGB
 Ok i know professionals generally hate Arduinos but I would like to know if it would be possible to program Atmel ARM chips using the Arduino IDE. By which I mean not needing to modify the source code just add another entry into the hardware folder and that\s it. We already know the Atmel ATSAM3X8EA Arduino DUE is compattible but how about a similar chip like the Atmel ATSAM3X8CA. Or maybe a Cortex-M4 one like the Atmel ATSAM4E16EA or the Atmel ATSAM4S8CA. The Atmel ATSAM3X8CA is the closest one to the Atmel ATSAM3X8EA the Arduino Due uses a bit smaller and with less I/O. If it isn\t possible without much source code modding I would like to know what would it take to make it work. Thanks for your answers.

 I have DATA_READY Activity and Inactivity interrupts mapped from INT1 to INT0 on the arduino. DATA_READY works fine the problem is Activity and Inactivity are always set to 0 in the INT_SOURCE register. I have set up the threshold for activity and inactivity and the time of inactivity. I would like the algorithm to run when DATA_READY and Activity interrupts are 1 and do nothing when Inactivity is 1 activity is 0. When Activity is 0 the accelerometer should go automatically in sleep mode and wakes up if activity is detected. #include &lt;Wire.h&gt;#include &lt;Adafruit_Sensor.h&gt;#include &lt;Adafruit_ADXL345_U.h&gt;#include &lt;avr/io.h&gt;#include &lt;avr/power.h&gt;#define F_CPU 16000000UL int state=0; //0--active detecting; 1--sleepingint state_count=0; //sleeping trigger between 2 statesdouble mag[40];int i=0;double acc_rate[39];int hunt_sub=0;int exit_marker=-10trough_marker=-30peak_marker=-10;volatile int sensor_update=0 active_mode=0;//active_mode=0 in
 I\m looking to drive two DC motors on a toy RC car using a Seeeduino and Seeed Motor Shield V2 but can\t manage to get the power scheme right. Right now a 9V battery connected to the shield powers everything i.e. LEDs are illuminated on the shield and seeeduino but when I try running the motors everything flickers and the motors don\t move I assume this is because there isn\t enough current. I\ve managed to get them working when plugging a USB and 9V battery at the same time into the seeeduino as well as when plugging a 9V into the seeeduino and another into the shield at the same time. Both of these configurations leave me feeling uneasy as I\m not sure how the power sources will interact. Further there is a jumper MB_EN on the shield which according to my research should isolate the shield from the seeeduino when removed. The documentation http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Motor_Shi

 Is anyone out there building serious metal detectors with the Arduino? By serious I mean metal detectors with phase sensitivity to discriminate between ferrous and non-ferrous metals etc. Seems like the Uno is a good platform for a smart metal detector project. 
 Any one know a component library for Arduino UNO Atmega328 etc for Protel 99 SE PCB design software? 
 So I just bought my first Arduino an Uno r3 and dove right in. All I have currently is the base board I didnt want to invest too heavily and then realize arduinos werent for me so I made a quick script that translates input letters to morse via the LED on the top. Now that Im done with that I figured Id come here to ask: do you guys have any random ideas for things I can make with JUST the uno? I understand that I should probably just start buying kits and shields but Im just curious as to what I can make with the most minimal of items. I consider it a test : Thanks in advance guys!

 I have a project that turns a LED strip on and off using capacitive touch. The project uses an Arduino Micro as the brain and a 12v wall wart to power everything. I have the Arduino ground and negative from the power supply running to a common ground. Everything works as expected during testing and the Arduino is connected via USB to my computer; however when I unplug the USB and connect the circuit to the light installation the lights just flicker on and off. When I touch my finger to the negative/ground and presumably provide common ground everything works as expected. It seems obvious to me that I have a grounding issue but really do not know how to proceed. Is there a specific technique for grounding from a wall wart? Do I need to somehow pull the ground/negative down? I feel like there is something obvious that I am missin
 Im building a project that will connect to users phones Android at first but iPhone too if theres enough interest via USB. Of course this means that I need a USB host in the project. The total size of the device has to be about the size of the phone so answers that seriously suggest shields arent going to be helpful - theyd put me over my size budget by at least a factor of 3. Id also rather not require an adapter to go from the USB Mini B connector type to the Micro B connector type. Gravitech has a USB Host board for the Nano 3 that has a USB Type A connector and the combination of a Nano and Gravitech Host is about the right size maybe a little thick once the whole thing is soldered to my own board but the USB host is $25. I can get the Nano for about $4 each and would like to keep the USB host in the neighborhood of $8 each. Are the solder fumes getting to me or is there such a specimen out there and Im just not finding it? 
 I recently bought an Arduino Pro Mini3.3V 328p 8Mhz along with a CP2102 USB to TTL UART convertor.

Any one have any ideas? 
 Just starting with Arduino and have gotten stuck at the first hurdle: trying to connect an Arduino Nano with my Mac Book Pro which runs 10.10. I can\t seem to find the right port as all suggestions have bluetooth in the name and none with USB anything. Also the post list does not change when I plug/unplug the Arduino. Looking at http://arduino.cc/en/guide/macOSX#toc3 it says that I need to install FTDI software to get the USB port to show however having done this it still does not work. Any suggestions?

 I have 4 rotary encoders connected to an MCP23017 which in turn is connected to interrupt port 0 on the arduino and to I2C of course. Everything works fine: I get interrupts for all 4 rotary encoders can read the values for them and even store these values in the EEPROM and load them in setup. Now I connect a WS2812 LED to the arduino with a resistor and a capacitator in front of it. I connect the UNO and the led lights up. I attach the serial console resetting the UNO and it stops working LED does not light up. This could just be simple wiring mistake and is not my real problem. I remove the LED and the capacitor from the board and start everything up again. I can see via the serial console that the UNO works however it does not receive any interrupts anymore. I exchange the MCP23017 thinking I fried it somehow but that doesn\t change anything eith

 I am new to this so what I ask may even not be possible.I have connected my usb arduino to a relay with the intention ofproviding a 5V surge to activate a garage door that is connectedto the other end of the relay.If I upload a digitalwrite command it will keep looping openingand closing the garage door continusouly. If I insert a while1command it will open the garade door once I upload the code.What I want is to be able to press a button in an html page ieand open/close the door. Where do I need to search to implement this?Is a serialevent command helpful? And how would I send a serialstring/integer from html/java to the arduino usb?Would it be better to have a way to reset the arduino everytime I wantto open or close the door? What interface should I use to achieve this? Thank you! : Kerveroc

 I have some code that generates random numbers on the Arduino it then sends these random numbers firstly using Serial.printfloat dataint lenght and as a floating point number using the following function void send_float float arg{ // get access to the float as a byte-array: byte * data = byte * &amp;arg; // write the data to the serial Serial.write data sizeof arg; Serial.println;} I then receive this data using python take the absolute difference of the two values discard any differences less than the length with which I send the string and output the rest to the screen. I observe two things a Fluctuations of the order with which I send the data ie. if I send to 6 decimal places then I see fluctuations of ~1e-6 this is reasonable and b I see fluctuations of absolute value 1e-8 or lower independent of what accuracy I send the string.

 How to get a One-Wire address of a given WS2812B pixel? I bought several of these and I cannot make them light. On the other hand when I connect the addressable LED strip made of these diodes I have no problem controlling it. Here is my set-up: I tried many programs e.g. AdaFruit_NeoPixel -> simple setting number of LEDS to 1 but no effect. No blinks nothing - as if the diodes were dead. If every One-Wire device is identifiable by 64 bit ID how does the Arduino know the correct order of the LEDS on the ribbon? How to tell the Arduino the new sequence of the LEDS on the strip that would result if I replace one broken LED with another?

 I have a project that requires 4 different RFID-RC522 readers. The RFID-RC522 has the following pins: SDA SCK MOSI MISO IRQ GND RST 3.3V I have read that the SDA pin is used for selecting the active device So Im thinking that these devices can share data pins. Is it possible to connect multiple RFID-RC522 readers to the same 3.3V RST GND IRQ MISO MOSI and SCK pins if you use a different pin for each SDA? If so this would save me a lot of pins. So far I have only seen direction on how to connect one RFID-RC522 to an Arduino. Im using the MFRC522 library. It appears to only support one reader because it only allows one SS pin to be identified in the constructor and offers no way to change it later. An I missing something or do I need another library? 
 I am trying to connect a camera to arduino mini pro using usb sheild. Is there a way the data can be sent via wifi from this system. 
 Ive been trying to write a very simple program using Arduino to tell a servo to go to a specific angle when a button is pressed and to another specific angle when it is released. I find that even though my sketch is but the simplest possible if then else statement without anything added to it the servo goes to the right angle when the button is pressed but when it is released the servo oscillates between the two specified angles at a regular rate about once every second. Whats even stranger is that when i add delay time to the end of the loop in my sketch the oscillation becomes more like twitching and the more delay i add the weirder and less predictable the twitching becomes. added info #include &lt;Servo.h&gt; Servo Servo1;int const switchPin = 4;int switchState = 0;void setup { Servo1.attach11; } void loop { switchState = digitalReadswitchPin; if switchState == HIGH { Servo1.write40; } else {
 I want to control my fog machine with an Arduino. Has a simple button that is used to activate the machine. I want to press this button using an Arduino digital output pin but the fog machine is operating on its own electrical circuit. How do I use the Arduino to activate this machine? I a few other machines with buttons that I want to wire into an Arduino so is there a generic solution? 
 I want to install several Arduino controlled relays which are use to turn on/off some lights a fog machine and some door locks in a building. What do I need to do to insure that the power relays dont violate building code? Do components need to be put in a box or can they be mounted to a 2x4?Are there requirements regarding the points were the bear wire is screwed into the relay? I am assuming that if anyone as ever wired an Arduino into a garage door opener these questions may have come up. 
 I am trying to add an on and off power switch to my arduino project. My project is running off a 9v battery and I would like to save as much power as I can. There might be a better why that I dont know. I added SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN to my project and from what I can tell the arduino enters sleep mode. I am having a hard time getting the arduino to wake from sleep mode. Am I able to do this from a full power down? I have been reading this link. http://www.gammon.com.au/forum/?id=11497 and others.

 Im currently trying to make 3 arduinos talking to each other with ZigBee and its kinda working.But I currently use AT mode on the Bees and its a little bit harsh when I have to switch the destination address in the Coordinator of the network 1 Coordinator and 2 Routers Can I put the Coordinator in API mode to make it easier to switch addresses with xbee-api for Arduino but still be able to communicate with the AT routers and be able to send/receive data from them? Thanks for your answer : 
 Ive searched high and low for something to get me on the right track its making me think it might not be possible. Basically I want to create a cheap SSD using Arduino or another microcontroller if it is too weak. I know I would have to implement the SATA protocol on the device and an OS driver for the disk drive. Assuming I could jump those two hurdles what else would bar me from implementing a rudimentary SSD? Im not even talking about full production quality just a SATA wire coming from a mother board plugged into a socket on a breadboard. Do I need flash storage or would I need another kind of chip to handle the data needs? 
 I am using Arduino Uno R3 with MPU 6050 for a personal project. MPU 6050 is being powered by the 3.3V supply pin in the Arduino board. In order to make the sensor mobile I ordered this battery which has one power output of 5V 1Amp that I plan on plugging into the Uno\s USB Power/Data Outlet. I know that when plugged into the computer via the same USB port around 5V 500 mA is supplied. I was wondering if someone could tell me whether the 1A battery that I ordered would burn my board or not . Also is there a built in fuse inside this board? 
 I have an Arduino Pro Micro ATMega32u4 that I want to use as an IR receiver for a media PC and need to send codes like Volume Up Media Home Play etc. But when I look up the scan codes for those and send them to Keyboard.press it just prints out 0 every time. Any way to send those keyboard commands? 
 Im still fairly new to Arduino projects and am only just now getting into building circuits where I want to cut and place my own hookup wire instead of using the precut jumper wires. I inherited some supplies from a friend who abandoned the hobby and about half of the wire he gave me is 22awg and the other half is 26awg. All of it is solid core copper. Is it ok to mix wire gauges like this in the same circuit/project?

 Having developed and tested a project using an Arduino Uno I would now like to upload it to an Arduino Pro Mini 5V 328 16MHz for semi-permanent long-term use but I can\t get any sign of life from the Pro Mini. I\m using the latest Arduino IDE v1.6.0 with Java 6 on Mac OS X Mavericks and I\ve got a USB 2.0 to TTL UART 6PIN CP2102 Module Serial Converter to connect the Pro Mini to the Mac and I\ve selected Tools > Board > Arduino Pro or Pro Mini 5V 16MHz w/ ATmega328. The problem is that I don\t see a suitable serial port in the list. When I plug in the Arduino Uno /dev/tty.usbmodem1421 immediately pops up in the Tools > Serial Port menu but I don\t see anything similar with the Mini Pro. The problem is probably in the connection between the USB/TTL converter and the Mini Pro so my question is: which pins sh

 I have a working project built around ATTiny85 on a breadboard running at 5V. Now I want to move this prototype on a PCB where it will be powered from batteries. All components used are capable of running 3.3V so I want to run the ATTiny85 at 3.3V as well. I dont have a programmer so I use ArduinoISP to program the ATTiny. If I change the fuses on Tiny to run it at 3.3V can I still use the 5V Arduino to program the tiny? Since the ATTiny can easily run at 5V I dont see any problem with programming it at 5V levels and then run it at 3.3V. Is that correct? 
 I am writing a simple Conway\s Game of Life implementation just to get to grips with the Nokia 3310 LCD and I am having problems with boolean arrays. I am using an unofficial Arduino Pro Micro 5V/16MHz Here\s the code that is causing me trouble: boolean buffer[84][48];void setup{ forint i = 0; i &lt; 84; i++{ forint j = 0; j &lt; 48; j++{ buffer[i][j] = true; } }}void loop{} When I upload this to the Arduino it seemingly freezes up with the RX led on and its COM port stops working. If I want to upload any other sketch I have to manually pull the RST pin LOW since the Pro Micro doesn\t have a reset button. I\ve been playing around with the code and found out that the source of problems is this line: buffer[i][j] = true; It also doesn\t matter if I use true or false . I have tried debugging with Serial to the computer but the Serial communication doesn\t

 Until yesterday I had 2 arduino nanos atmega328 16Mhz 5V and they worked finewhen I changed the cable and was able to upload code to them. Then I tried to make a breadboard arduino but my PC win8.1 was unable to see my FDTI 232RL USB2Serial converter as a COMPORT so I tried to download drivers but nothing worked out.Anyway I decided to reinstall windows and now one of my Nano works just fine but the Other appears as a FT232 USB UART at the device managerso I stepped back... Can anyone help me with that?

 I have an Arduino device and Im trying to read two voltages. The first one is the Arduino Vcc by using the bandgap value 1.1V this requires raw access to registers since its not implemented in analogRead. The other one is checking the battery voltage using the badgap as a reference. I want both of them because Im doing a study on the battery life when using a step-up converter. Im using these pieces of code: // Read bandgap with Vcc as reference - this will give use the VccADMUX = DEFAULT &lt;&lt; 6 | 14;delayMicroseconds250;bitSetADCSRA ADSC;whilebit_is_setADCSRA ADSC ;word x = ADC;Serial.printlnx;// Read A1 with 1.1V bandgap as reference - this will give battery voltageADMUX = INTERNAL &lt;&lt; 6 | 1;delayMicroseconds250;bitSetADCSRA ADSC;whilebit_is_setADCSRA ADSC ;word x = ADC;Serial.printlnx; The problem that I have is that separately they seem to work well however when using them together the first piece o

 I have been working with the wire library I2C to send data from one Arduino to another. I read that the Arduino can only send 6 bytes per cycle but I have been able to transfer much larger strings. This code works without error: Wire.beginTransmission4; // transmit to device #4 forint i = 0; i &lt; 20; i ++{ char rand = random65 100; Wire.writerand; } Wire.endTransmission; // stop transmitting How is this possible? It seams that 32 characters can be sent without trouble. I read this here: http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/MasterReader Arduino 1 the Master is programmed to request and then read 6 bytes of data sent from the uniquely addressed Slave Arduino. Now that I look at this again after reading the responses I think that the limit was set in the code sample.

 For my project I have 3 ultrasonic sensors and 3 vibrating motors; the motors need to buzz for a small amount of time then wait for a specific time that corresponds whith the range of the ultrasonic sensor then muzz again. The problem I\m having is that I used delays at first but that would cause the third motor only to buzz after the first two already waited. I basically need something like digitalWritemotorPin_1 HIGH for X amount of time;and at the same moment it has to start digitalWritemotorPin_2 HIGH for X amount of time;. Sadly I can\t get the motors to vibrate any softer or harder so I use these intervals.

 Im trying to control an Arduino-powered motorized toy with a differential drive. However I want to code it the motor movements with a direction vector. e.g. 10 = forward-10 = backward01 = turn left pivoting on center axis0-1 = turn right pivoting on center axis11 = forward-left pivoting on left wheel1-1 = forward-left pivoting on right wheel I thought the equation to convert these to the literal motor signals was: float mag = sqrtdirX*dirX + dirY*dirY;float left = dirX - dirY;float right = dirX + dirY; This seems to work for the first 4 cases but fails for the last two where it results in an un-normalized vector. One potential fix would be to simple wrap left and right in min to stop it from going over 1.0 but that feels like a hack and would possibly lose resolution. Is there a more elegant fix?
