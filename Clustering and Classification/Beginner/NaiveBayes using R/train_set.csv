1	 Im making a simple Arduino web server and I want to keep it turned on all the time. So it must endure to stay working continuously. Im using an Arduino Uno with a Ethernet Shield.Its powered with a simple outlet power supply 5V @ 1A. My Questions: Will I have any problems leaving the Arduino turned on all the time? Is there some other Arduino board better recommended for this? Are there any precautions that I need to heed regarding this? 
1	 Put plainly: is there a way to get an HTTPS connection on the Arduino? I have been looking in to it and I have found it is impossible with the standard library and the Ethernet shield but is there a custom library that can do it? What about a coprocessor i.e. like the WiFi shield has? Anyone know if the Arduino yn has ssl? 
1	 For solar &amp; battery powered projects decreasing power consumption is a necessity. I know a little bit about using a timer and interrupt to put the microcontroller into sleep when it isn\t doing anything. I have also read that you can disable some peripherals to further save power. Here is a page explaining these: Power Saving Techniques My question: What other techniques are there to save power? Are there any libraries that make using these AVR features easier? 
1	 I have an original Arduino UNO R3 that I bought and an Arduino Severino S3V3 that I\ve built. I have no problems uploading sketches to the UNO but sometimes when uploading to the Severino board I have to hard reset it at a specific time during the upload process when the IDE says something like this below: avrdude: Version 5.11 compiled on Sep 2 2011 at 19:38:36 Copyright c 2000-2005 Brian Dean http://www.bdmicro.com/ Copyright c 2007-2009 Joerg Wunsch System wide configuration file is C:\\arduino-1.0.3\\hardware/tools/avr/etc/avrdude.conf Using Port : \\\\.\\COM1 Using Programmer : arduino Overriding Baud Rate : 115200avrdude: Send: 0 [30] [20] avrdude: Send: 0 [30] [20] avrdude: Send: 0 [30] [20] If I don\t reset it when one of the Send messages
1	 The strangest thing is happening to a standalone Arduino board that I designed and built. The board whose schematics are below has the following features: It has a ATmega328P with a 5V voltage regulator and usual circuitry when set up as a standalone controller. It controls a scoreboard with several 7-display digits linked through the connectors on the right JP1 through JP12. It has cursor buttons decoded using a voltage ladder through ANALOG_0 A0. It has a Real Time Clock to keep time when it\s turned off. It has an RF receiver module. It has a UART header JP17 so I can program the board using a serial port. It has a speaker attached to digital pin 3 D3. I upload sketches to it using a RS232-to-TTL adapter that I\ve also built schematics also below and a Serial-to-USB cable. When programming it the board behaves much
1	 I bought an Ethernet Shield R3 for my Arduino Uno R2 but since R3 has extra pins it does not fit. Can I use the shield? Should I cut off the extra pins. What do I need to do to make it work? 
1	 I have a uno that I have been using for 3 years now. I will be using it again in a rather critical project in which failure on the part of the board could be rather expensive and dangerous. So I would like to be sure that the board is not approaching end of life or going to fail anytime soon. Is there any reliable way to figure out how long the board will function without failing or reduction in performance? 
1	 I wanted to make a fairly simple circuit which would flash a series of LEDs in sequence using my Arduino Uno more specifically a SainSmart clone. I wrote my sketch and it compiled fine. After that I connected 8 LEDS+resistors to pins 0 through 7 and then connected the Uno to my computer via USB. Ive uploaded sketches successfully in the past so Im sure my settings and drivers etc. are correct. However when I tried to upload my sketch this time it didnt work. I tried removing everything Id connected to the Arduinos pins and suddenly the upload worked again. Why does this happen? Does it mean I have to disconnect everything from the board every time I upload a sketch? 
1	 Ive been experimenting with an 8x8 LED matrix controlled by an Arduino Uno. As I think is typical the matrix uses a common anode for each row and a common cathode for each column. At the moment Ive got all the matrix pins connected directly to IO pins on the Uno and I havent had any problems lighting the LEDs one-by-one. Going through the whole matrix like this makes updates a little slow though meaning the LEDs arent as bright as Id like. As far as I know I cant safely light up an entire row at once because an individual pin on the Uno isnt capable of sourcing enough current to drive 8 separate LEDs at the same time requiring at least 10mA each to be bright enough. It occurred to me that the reverse might be safer. If I light up an entire column at a time then each pin only has to source enough current for one LED which should be no problem. However it relies on one pin potentially sinking the current from all 8 totalling at least 80mA. 
1	 I currently have a Mega2560 with the LCD4884 Shield. The Shield is good for putting out text and simple pixel images. But I am wondering if there is something that has a full range of colours that would work with the Arduino? The screen size would only have to be a few inches in size. 
1	 We have an LED strip connected to output 6 and is powered by the Uno board itself. Shouldnt be drawing too much current only have 10 elements on the LED strip. While this LED strip is connected to the Uno I noticed that the regulator is getting very hot. One thing we havent done yet is to power the LED strips from an external source which will be necessary since there will be many strips. At the moment the students are simply trying to debug their program with the small strip. 
1	 Is it possible to have more than 14 output pins on the Arduino I am working on a project in which I need to light up several LEDs individually. I only have an Arduino Uno and I dont want to get a Mega. 
1	 What hardware and software solutions work and what are the tradeoffs for connecting an Arduino Due to the internet? I gather the ethernet hardware is much cheaper than WiFi hardware 29 versus 69. In either case wired or wireless what software stacks and drivers work under AtmelStudio? 
1	 There are some pins on the Arduino which I havent been able to find out anything about: IOREF AREF An unlabeled one next to IOREF What are they? 
1	 I want to use sensors on an Arduino to control values in a MATLAB program. What are my options for communicating? I\ve used Processing to receive data sent via the serial cable and that strategy has worked pretty well. Is there something similar I can do using MATLAB? I\m somewhat new to MATLAB so gentle guidance would be great. I\m not really looking for something like the ArduinoIO package -- I want to have separate computation executing on the Arduino and occasionally informing my MATLAB program which will occasionally poll the serial line I suppose. 
1	 I\m using a DigiX Arduino Due based 3.3V board to connect to a GPRS/GSM SIM908 breakout board. The SIM908 EVB board has the following pins on its RS232: I\ve got all three UART TX lines hooked up to the RX Lines and RX to TX on my Arduino but the board keeps resetting which I would guess is some sort of voltage issue I turned the board off immediately. However there are three MAX3232s on the underside of the board which I thought would have made it so I could just connect the lines directly to the Arduino. Does anyone know why this might be happening or how to properly connect these two devices? Additional info: Pinout of the DigiX . Schematic of the DigiX . 
1	 At least for prototyping is there a semi-permanent way to attach wires to the Nano posts? And yes usually the Nano is hanging in free space by its wires yes I know quick and dirty should be using something cleaner even for prototypes. So I\m hoping for the best of both worlds sturdy enough to stay attached yet possible to remove and switch around. Having no luck finding such advice on the internet perhaps searching for the wrong terms. EDIT: I neglected one important point each wire is attached individually just like the SparkFun wires with the female header as mentioned in @TheDoctor\s answer below. 
1	 Im planning an Arduino system that consists of several Arduino boards. The maximum distance between the boards is about 50 meters. I want to send basic data between these like short strings or integers. I know I could send data through ethernet cables but that requires an ethernet shield or the Arduino Ethernet board that doubles the costs. Is there a low budget way I could connect the boards using only the most basic boards like Uno and some other components but not a full shield? 
1	 Making a blinking light seems to be one of the most common beginner projects with Arduino. A typical approach is to connect an LED + resistor in series to an IO pin and connect the other end to ground. In code you make the pin an output and bring it HIGH and LOW repeatedly to flash the LED. What happens if you leave that resistor out? Obviously youre going to wreck the LED but will it also damage the Arduino in some way? 
1	 According to the Arduino reference for analogWrite the PWM frequency on most pins is ~490 Hz. However it\s ~980 Hz for pins 5 and 6 on the Uno and for pins 3 and 11 on the Leonardo. Why are these different? Is it a deliberate design feature or is it somehow dictated by the hardware? 
1	 I am looking for simple low cost solution in which I would like control on/off of mains supply to certain equipment. The control will be done using one of the output pin of Arudino Uno. The input trigger and how control it is application dependent. e. g. controlling an equipment or controlling supply to section of home but in principle mains control module implementation remains same. So looking for solution which safe while doing connections as well while in use in in-door conditions for years. 
1	 On the hardware side of things what is involved in making the Arduino receive signals from a TV Remote? What kind of infrared receiver is needed? Do TV remotes use some kind of channels encoding or encryption requiring special receivers or else additional programming work to decrypt the signals? 
1	 Spanish company Libelium makes this pretty impressive sensor board: http://www.libelium.com/products/waspmote/sensors/ for their Waspmote series of boards. These are not meant for Arduino compatibility but they are not only interesting for combining so many sensors the availability of calibrated sensor sets makes it even more unique. So here is the challenge: can we reasonably leverage these from an Uno or a Mega? 
1	 I am involved in a project that is going to measure PH and chlorine in a swimming pool. The plan is to use a Arduino Yun. The sensors we are going to use are connected using serial. Since we may be using multiple sensors is there any difference in reliability latency known issues bugs of using software serial versus pin0 and pin1? Is it any way to avoid software serial pitfalls if there are any? 
1	 Ive been hearing a lot about clones and counterfeits. What are the differences between the two? 
1	 I bought a SainSmart clone board which is compatible with the Arduino Uno R3. Alongside each of the standard IO pins there is a row of 3 additional pins male. They are arranged in columns marked S V and G. They can be seen on this image: Most of them are immediately above the SainSmart and UNO logos. The SVG pins corresponding to the analog pins can be seen immediately below the microprocessor. What are these pins for? Is this a standard format for some applications or is it something unique to the SainSmart? 
1	 I know there are different revisions of the Arduino Uno itself but are there any revisions of the SMD? If they are is SMD R2 identical to through-hole R2? I have a board marked R2 SMD and I am wondering if that is the only version that they produced in SMD format and just are signifying that it is compatible with the standard R2. 
1	 Im trying to use an unusual 16x2 LCD display with my Uno. As far as I know its an EA-X16027AR. It doesnt seem to be compatible with the HD44780 driver which is typically used for Arduino LCDs. According to the datasheet the displays ENB Enable pin requires a clock input described as follows: Basical Clock to perform Instructions in Controller LSI. The Clock at the same timing as MPU are usually input. The timing graphs elsewhere in the datasheet show it wants a speed of around 2 MHz. Is it possible to get the internal clock signal from the Uno scale it down to 2 MHz and output it to a GPIO pin or similar? Alternatively is it possible to emulate a clock signal at that speed on-board without adding additional timing components? 
1	 Im looking for a broadly applicable solution one that can be adapted to a variety of projects. Im currently working on several projects that each require controlling devices ranging from 800mA to 2A from an Arduino Uno. One controls stepper motors one controls 12vdc solenoid actuators and one controls 12vdc pneumatic valves. For example: The Arduino monitors a button and each time the button is pressed it triggers the solenoid actuator. Because the Arduino is unable to source the current required by the solenoid a seperate power supply is required with the Arduino controlling a switch relay transistor etc. that allows the higher current to pass. For the stepper motor the layout is more complex as there would need to be four pins controlling four separate switches to maintain interoperability of the circuit. The relay controls an air valve and requires 12vdc as well. Im trying to figure out how to use a single circuit that can be used in each
1	 Ive been using a button to interact with a sketch on my Uno and its mostly working fine. However sometimes it seems to be detecting multiple presses when its only pressed once. Its a small circuit-mounted momentary button which is normally open. Its connected from +5V directly to an input pin. Ive also added a 10K pull-down resistor on the pin to make sure the input isnt left floating. Heres a test sketch Ive been using which reports the number of presses to the serial monitor: int oldState = LOW;int numPresses = 0;void setup{ pinMode5 INPUT; Serial.begin9600;}void loop{ const int newState = digitalRead5; if newState != oldState { if newState == HIGH Serial.println++numPresses; oldState = newState; }} Sometimes when I press the button once the serial monitor shows two presses in a row. It sometimes even reports a press when I release the button. Is it possible to fix
1	 Im working on a free space optics project to send data wirelessly between two points. To accomplish this Im using an IR LED connected to an Arduino Uno that pulses with a 56khz carrier frequency for the transmitter and a second Arduino with a 56khz IR detector module for the receiver. I tried using delayMicroseconds between pin high and pin low commands in order to create the carrier frequency. This kind of works but the frequency isnt always the same and any additional delays for pulsing the signal i.e. the time required to call the function and decrementing can change it. Reading the datasheet for the Atmega328 it appears that there is a way to set a more accurate pulse using the chips timers. Is that possible and if so how do you create a 56khz pulse using the timers? 
1	 I currently have an Uno which operates at 5v and Im looking at buying a Due which only operates at 3.3v. Id like to make them communicate via Serial or SPI or similar but presumably connecting them directly isnt an option I guess the Dues pins would get damaged. Is there any way to make the connection safe? Or is there an alternative form of communication I could safely use between them instead? 
1	 Will it still run on less than 5 volts? Will it break? 
1	 Im working on building a solar powered Arduino based weather station. The weather station consists of a temperature sensor and a photoresistor and I plan to add an anemometer in the future. I would like to connect the weather station to my wireless network so that I can retrieve the sensor data from my computer without having to run wires I live in a rental. What are the different options for connecting the Arduino to WiFi? Ive looked at ethernet shields WiFi shields and something called Xbee but I dont understand what each of them are for. I also have a wireless home router that I could use. Is it possible to connect my Arduino Uno to the router via the routers ethernet or USB port and then receive data from and send commands to the Arduino wirelessly over my home network? If so how would this be accomplished? I currently have a bare Arduino Uno. 
1	 I am new to the world of Arduinos but have a new project going with a MultiWii Flight controller. With the MultiWii comes a software for showing all data that is measured from the sensors acceleration velocity roll pitch etc which is nice but I would like to have/extract this data call raw data or something from all sensors i.e. the data plotting everything in numbers. Maybe it is the simplest thing to do and I guess I have to set up some serial connection between the controller and tell it to send this data somehow but I do not know where to start so any guidance and help is appreciated. 
1	 I am working with some code for remote temperature sensor nodes. They turn the debug interface on and off depending on if anything is conneced to the serial port or not. The code is on Github here . Line 111 is the line of interest: if Serial debug = 1; else debug=0; //if serial UART to USB is connected show debug O/P. So a simple question: On a hardware and software level how does this work? I can\t see anything in HardwareSerial or Stream that would return true/false if anything was connected or not. Note that I am not confident that it actually works. This simple test indicates it doesn\t work as the LED flashes regardless of the presence of
1	 If I upload any sketch that sends serial data I immediately see the TX/RX LEDs flash once the sketch is uploaded. If I then start the serial monitor the sketch appears to restart. A bare minimum sketch that shows this behaviour: void setup{ Serial.begin9600; Serial.printlnSetup;}void loop{ Serial.printlnLoop; delay1000;} Tested with several boards and Mac and Windows versions of the IDE. Example output - it goes back to Setup when I open the serial monitor: Why is this? 
1	 I\m just a tinkerer learning Arduino with my son and I was surprised that when I plugged the USB cord back in to the Arduino the program was still running and I thought to myself it\s a good thing I didn\t just blow anything up. So what\s the normal way people call it a day with these things? Do you usually load up the bare-bones do nothing sketch or just unplug everything? 
1	 I have an espresso machine that gets its water from one of those 5 gallon blue water bottles I would plumb it but our water here is WAAAAY too hard. If I ever accidentally let the bottle run out of water the rotary pump in the espresso machine will be ruined which would be a costly mistake. I know that I can install some sort of magnetic float sensor inside the water bottle but since I have to change it out once every few weeks having another thing inside the bottle would make changing it out harder and microbial contamination more likely. The pump that pumps water out of the bottle forms a tight seal at the lid and anything running under it or through it would compromise that seal. Is there something I could use to detect if the water level is low from the outside of the bottle? Like a laser sensor? 
1	 I am making an interface project that when plugged into a computer shows up as both usb flash storage and can type like a keyboard when some physical buttons on the board are pressed. I have seen projects that do one or the other but not both at the same time. I have gotten it to work using a usb hub and two chips that are sharing the same storage since I want the hot-key buttons to type out information stored in the flash drive side as well with one acting like a HID and one acting as usb storage but this has a few problems. First it feels redundant. Second its difficult to program since every time I plug the mess in it randomly assigns a name to each chip with no easy way of telling which to send the HID code to and with to send the USB Drive code to. I have to plug them in one at a time which wont work once this project is all on the same board. The last problem is the buttons work inconsistently since im assuming the two chips are not doing a nice job of
1	 I have an object with a series of led and I want to turn on and off these leds from my Arduino. The input of the LED circuit is 24v DC 100mA. What Ive done is the following: Ive cut a wire of this object and I connected one end to the collector and the other end to the emitter of a NPN transistor I connected the base of the transistor to a digital output through a 1k resistance I connected the power to the led series while the digital pin was LOW actually completely disconnected But with no current on the base of the transistor the LED has turned on to my surprise. I may have completely misused the transistor and other items. How do I fix this circuit? 
1	 I am working on a UAV and we are currently exploring inertial measurement units or IMUs. The two options that we have come across are: Using an Arduino Uno and a 9 DOF IMU like this one Using an ArduIMU chip like this one Ignoring the cost aspect and assuming the same microprocessor on board what would be the pros and cons of either of these approaches? Keep in mind that performance is very important for a UAV controller as ESCs require 60 Hz or higher refresh rates for stable flight. 
1	 Anyone with kids knows they never help with the toilet paper. Anyone know how to track when its low or out and sound an audible alarm? I just dont know what sensor to use that may help. Some that came to mind are: by weight by reflection the color of the paper or some laser tripwire - all right on the spool. I dont mind building it its just I dont know which sensor. Anyone know which to use? 
1	 Ignore the stalker-like title. I am thinking about creating a project with Arduino that can sense you sleep habits when youre asleep and how much you sleep. It would be convenient to not have to turn it on/off at night; it should know how to do this. Some ideas that I have: Motion sensor Breathing patterns if an Arduino microphone could even pick that out... I would be surprised if it could A RTC clock could assist in deciding Its midnight. Usual Steve isnt asleep at this time on Fridays. Hes probably not sleeping now. It wont always be there to help you but you might be able to try to get more accurate results this way How can I accomplish this? Extra points for some sort of algorithm that can tell dozing off from a deep sleep. 
1	 I have an Arduino motor shield like this one plugged into my Mega board. I would like to know some more information about the orange and white pin blocks on the board. The Arduino website has the following information but it doesn\t give any explanation of what is best to use them for or which pins are mapped to the data pins etc. TinkerKit connectors for two Analog Inputs in white connected to A2 and A3. TinkerKit connectors for two Aanlog Outputs in orange in the middle connected to PWM outputs on pins D5 and D6. TinkerKit connectors for the TWI interface in white with 4 pins one for input and the other one for output. What I want to do is connect a servo up to the board and was hoping I could use one of the orange OUT blocks. I haven\t been successful in f
1	 Ive seen many temperature sensors but the highest temperature they go up to is 125 degrees C 257 degrees F. I want to reach higher temperatures than that. Im thinking about rigging up a closed loop sensor for my soldering iron for a convenient LCD display but I cant find out how to sense the temperature of the tip due to the higher operating temperature than most sensors. 
1	 I want an I/O pin to return current in a circuit similarly to the function of ground. Which of these will achieve what I require? pinModepinnumber OUTPUTdigitalWritepinnumber LOW or pinModepinnumber input 
1	 How can I run a webserver in a Arduino Uno? I want to use my Arduino to monitor things in my home such as temperature. I want to be able to access this data through the internet. 
1	 The Arduino Uno Page doesn\t say the temperatures that it can operate in. I\m thinking about placing it outdoors. How can I make sure my Arduino Uno is safe in weather that can reach -20 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit? -26 to 40 degrees Celsius. 
1	 Presumably one powers an Arduino board with car batteries for long-term operation away from the power grid. How can this be done and what are the most 1 economic and 2 reliable ways to do this? Specifically do any additional risks to short the board with an extraneous discharge exist? 
1	 Currently I am developing a graphic LCD system to display temperatures flows voltages power and energy in a heat pump system. The use of a graphic LCD means that half of my SRAM and ~75% of my flash have been used up by a screen buffer and strings. I am currently displaying min/max/average figures for energy At midnight when the daily figure resets the system checks if the consumption for the day is above or below the previous minimum or maximum and stores the value. The average is calculated by dividing the cumulative energy consumption by the number of days. I would like to display the daily average over the last week and month 4 weeks for simplicity i.e. a rolling average. Currently this involves maintaining an array of values for the last 28 days and calculating an average over the whole array for monthly and last 7 days for weekly. Initially I was doing this using an array of floats as the energy is in the form 12.12kWh but this was using 28 * 4 by
1	 Clearly an Arduino can be powered with solar panels. What is the most optimal configuration? Can you recharge and discharge at the same time? Is LiPO the best battery cache technology or is there something more durable out there for fielded deployment? What are the most economic and reliable ways to do this? 
1	 The Space Replay A hovering object that explores and manipulates transitional public spaces with particular acoustic properties. By constantly recording and replaying these ambient sounds the levitating sphere produces a delayed echo of human activity. In this project the Arduino board and an Adafruit Wave Shield is used. The Wave shield is not designed to record audio however they say that they use the board for both recording and playback. The sphere responds sonically to people and its surroundings by means of a battery-powered Arduino an Adafruit Wave Shield hacked to record and playback audio on-the-fly and a small speaker. This generates a few questi
1	 I am using an Arduino Uno to send time and voltage information over the serial port to Python to plot. However the interval timings between successive time stamps appears to be increasing over time affecting my plotting. This is especially true when the baud rate is set to 9600 where my initial time differences maybe 1320 and increases to 16400 after a relatively short period of time. When this rate is put to maximum of 115200 bps the change is slower and less noticeable from around 1340 to 1500 even after a relatively long run of sending. All times are given in microseconds. I would like to know if I can reduce or eliminate this effect and if not understand why it exists. I have read things about interrupts and delays causing this but I do not fully appreciate the complexity of the electronics at hand and would like to know: Can I get greater precision in the timing? What causes this change in timing? Here is what I currently have: <pr
1	 I need to communicate between two Arduinos using XBee. I am new to XBee and hardware. The two Arduino Unos need to send a message number to each other and light an LED or play a sound when they come close within a 10 meter distance. So my doubt is which XBee shield and XBee module I need to purchase. I read about XBee series 2 XB24 etc. 
1	 I have done various applications with the Ultrasonic example project but it is always using one pinger. I\d like to make a scanner resting on a servo sweep but to reduce sweep time use more than one censor. the documentation is rather basic ping sonic that states the signal 40khz is used. Down to the question now. Is there a means to tell one pinger to use 40Khz and another say 45Khz. This would allow me to scan two areas different directions per cycle reducing the time frame to complete area scan by half. 
1	 I have a few Arduino Pro Mini clones cheap Chinese stuff and would like to power them with 12V power supply same as fan voltage. According to the Arduino Pro Mini spec the RAW pin can take 3.35-12V 3.3V model. In practice this means a 12V PSU cannot be used as they are almost always over 12V with low load. I read that the voltage regulator in this board is capable up to 16V input. I tried plugging in a cheap 12V power adapter that read 15.1V with no load but a component on the arduino clone board actually exploded instantly. The board seems to work still when powered from usb programmer. Component that burned out is just above VCC RST and GND pins. Why did this happen? What did I just damage and most importantly what is a safe voltage level to use? I already have a few 12V switching power supplies it would be a shame if I could not use them. Solution: In the end it seems
1	 I would like to constantly save data coming from sensors for an activity tracker while consuming as less battery as possible Id like to have a 4/5 days autonomy on a 3000 mAh battery but I cant find the best way to save about 2 kBytes/s on a memory large enough to contain several days of data. Sensors would be read at a rate of 20 times per second and produce about 100 bytes each time. What options do I have in order to: store such an amount of data hardware? ensure the system can work properly with required autonomy? 
1	 On my Arduino Uno R3 and Arduino Mega R3 there are 5V and 3.3V pins. However on this page http://arduino.cc/en/reference/board there is a 5V and 9V pin but no 3.3V pin. The page at http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/WhatAdapter also mentions a 9V pin. Why is there a discrepency? 
1	 I bought a Gertboard a while ago and one of the features it has on-board is an ATMega328 DIP. However since the Gertboard is designed for use with the Raspberry Pi it only operates at 3.3v so the clock speed is limited to ~12MHz. Programming it via the Raspberry Pi is quite cumbersome though. Instead Id like to transfer the chip to an Arduino Uno board so I can upload sketches from my desktop PC. I would then transfer it back to the Gertboard for normal operation. The problem is that my Uno operates at the more typical 5v / 16MHz. Is it safe to attempt this? Do I need to make any configuration changes in the IDE to tell it to account for a different clock speed? 
1	 Why is the Arduino able to accept ~5V from the USB but requires a min of 7V when using an external power supply? 
1	 I am working on a heating control system for my home but having problems with the temperature sensor reading higher than I expect. I have a 5V Arduino Mini Pro clone hooked up to a relay module an HD47780 display and a Tiny RTC module with a DS18B20 attached to it. The DS18B20 is powered from the 5v Vcc applied to the Tiny RTC module rather than using parasitic power on the DQ line as I wasn\t sure if the Onewire libraries supported this mode of operation and the DS18B20 datasheet says that Vcc may be between 3.0v and 5.5v. I measured the regulated power from the Mini Pro\s being at 5.2v. I am comparing the temperature from the DS with the existing room thermostat bi-metallic an RS desktop temperature monitor with two sensors a small \thermo-hygrometer\ and a <a href=http://ecx.images-amazon.com
1	 I\m trying to make an RF remote control using ATtiny85 running at 8MHz on internal oscillator this cheap RF 434MHz transmitter module like the one below and VirtualWire lib but had no success so far . So before I go any further is it possible to use VirtualWire with ATtiny85 running at 3.6V and 8MHz with its internal oscillator? If so how? I\ve found a few scattered sources of information on the Net about it but couldn\t make much sense of it. I have build ATMega328 versions of the receiver and transmitter using VirtualWire without any major problems. Both modules talk to each other will very little data drop out. Now when I tried to replace the ATMega328 transmitter with a smaller vers
1	 Im completely new with Arduino and microcontrollers in general. I have several 5V sensors and need 3.3V because thats the max for the Due. Is it possible to use a resistor to connect it to the Arduino? Do I have to measure the current from the sensor and calculate the needed resistor like this? $$\\frac{5.0 - 3.3}{\\text{Measured current}}$$5.0 - 3.3/Measured current 
1	 There are a lot of methods to power an arduino from a large range of voltages usb cable from pc or from a phone charger or an usb hub step down convertors step up converters switching power supply batteries connected to the power jack or usb or to Vin What I cant seem to find is a small 220v-5v converter. Id like to put an arduino in the wall under a light switch so size matters. The last resort option is to open a 5v phone charger and replace the metal prongs that go in a socket with two wires and replace the usb socket with anoter pair of wires that go the arduino board but still an Arduino Pro Mini or an Arduino Nano is smaller than the phone charger. Thank you for your time

1	 I would like to be able to use a USB port at the same time as an RS-232 port with my Arduino Uno board. I unwittingly bought a shield that I think? overrides the USB port when it is mounted to the Arduino board: http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/RS232_Shield Would anyone be able to give me any advice on how to connect the hardware so that I can have two serial ports accessible from my Arduino Uno?

1	 I have a relatively cheap 0-15psi pressure transducer. It has 3 pins - ground 5V and signal. The signal outputs a voltage of 0.5V to 4.5V based on pressure from 0psi to 15psi. I can verify it does respond to significant pressure increases so it works at least to a point. The issue is that the reading from arduino can differ by over 50% when at ambient atmospheric pressure resting on a table. It should be significantly more accurate if the sensor data are to be trusted. The code is basic: void setup{ Serial.begin9600;}void measurePressure{ int rawReading = analogReadA0; // Range : 0..1024 //float rawVoltage = rawReading * 4.5 / 1023.0 + 0.5; Serial.printRaw reading: ; Serial.printlnrawReading;}void loop { measurePressure; delay1000;} The output variations are not entirely random it seems that the reading goes down and up in intervals of roughly 5-15 seconds. Below is a sample output: Raw reading: 61R
1	 I\m doing my first electronics project where a signal that varies between -1 to 1 V is going into an analog pin on the Arduino. The amplified signal has to be read as fast as possible by Arduino. The source signal is at 60 Hz. Will this LM324 be a suitable 4-channel opamp for my needs? How concerned should I be about the 2 mV input offset and 20 nA input current bias? To make full use of the 10bit ADC would you recommend using an opamp with gain of 2 and biasing the signal by +2.5V? If so will it be better to create the bias using a potential divider across +5V and GND or using a 2.5V voltage regulator? Or would it be better to set AREF to 2V and bias the signal by +1V? In this case will it be better to use a 2V voltage regulator or a voltage divider across Arduino\s 3V3 and GND using 20M and 33M resistors? 
1	 I am sending three signals from one arduino mega to another using xbees. On the receiving end I am using these signals in a Simulink code to control servo motors. Currently it is set up to read from analog pins without the wireless set up. With the wireless technology the signals are all being sent and received through one serial port. I believe I would need to change the inputs in Simulink to a serial receive block instead of an analog pin block. The problem is the documentation for the serial receive block says you can not assign more than one serial receive block to the same serial port. If anyone has a solution to this it would be greatly appreciated! receiving code int received1; int received2; int received3; void setup { Serial.begin9600; } void loop { ifSerial.available { received1 received2 received3 = Serial.read; } } transmitting code: void setup { Serial.begin9600;}void loop {

1	 I\m trying to simply access my HC_05 bluetooth module and conduct some AT commands through the Serial Monitor. For some reason though it only seems to be returning Null characters though it does some to be actually responding to the command in some way given by the length of Null characters it returns. So you can clearly see that the command AT and AT+NAMEdevice return different data but they are both all NUL blocks. I am viewing the monitor in text. Changing the view to Hex or ASCII does not change results. Code for this simple program is below: #include &lt;SoftwareSerial.h&gt;SoftwareSerial BTSerial10 11; // RX | TXvoid setup{ pinMode9 OUTPUT; // this pin will pull the HC-05 pin 34 key pin HIGH to switch module to AT mode digitalWrite9 HIGH; Serial.begin9600; Serial.printlnEnter AT comma
1	 What is the maximum power consumption in mW of the Arduino Nano 3.0 when it is running in its default state at 16MHz no LEDs removed and powered by an external regulated 5V supply so it bypasses the built in voltage regulator. This will give us an upper bound on the power consumption of the Arduino Nano that can be used during estimates. 
1	 Whilst it is possible and sometimes desirable to use pin change interrupts to read the state of buttons it is simpler to poll the state of buttons in loop . This is a commonly used technique. If you loop executes quickly enough then button presses are always going to be caught and the user will not be able to perceive any delay or lag. It is possible that your loop would take so long as to cause a delay or lag to be perceived. The question is how long would it be in general before a user would see this?

So: GPS &gt; listen onlyGSM &gt; listen and write Now I came across the GPS library from Adafruit which uses an interrupt to receive data. Is this instead of a software serial. Or do I again run into the limitation? An other solution might be to use the D0 and D1 to attach eg the GPS module. But than I won\t be able to see the debug messages in my serial monitor.

1	 So I am working on speeding up a nixie tube speedometer in this question: but this brought up another question. Would having matching baud rates for multiple external devices speed up processes. In the case of the other question the OBD-II device is running at 38400 where the Nixie Tubes are running at 9600. Since I\m taking the info from the OBD-II connector and doing a little math and sending it to the Nixie Tubes would it be beneficial to have the same baud rate for both devices? Now... before you down-vote this question for making some sort of duplicate this also answers a question about having a master serial hub and having communication between different slave serial devices.

I have all the rest of the driver working properly steps direction etc. but when I hook up a wire to either the sleep or enable section and send a respective high or low it doesn\t appear to do anything. Chip works as normal power consumption stays the same. I have tested to see that the Arduino is outputting correctly and it seems to be. But other than this I\m kinda at a loss on what might be wrong. Does anyone have any suggestions on why this might be or other things to test to try to narrow down the problem? Found my answer from Sparkfun - see below 
1	 I have got Arduino Mega 2560 Arduino WiFi Shield and resistor 1.5K. Now PWM 2 is attached to Res. then attached GND. 5V is attached between PWM2 and resistor\s up point. I want to read Arduino Mega\s A7 Analog Input point in order to print this value on Android Phone\s web browser. But I get zero value everytime surprisingly. It should be like 235 350 something like integer or float kinds as usual. According to Android Phone\s Google Chrome Web Browser Page why there are too many zeros in the HTML? It should be different from zeros because I have already added a short wire to Analog A7 so as to make an antenna. #include &lt;SPI.h&gt;#include &lt;WiFi.h&gt;char ssid[] = Connectify-me; char pass[] = ***; int status = WL_IDLE_STAT
1	 Is it possible to cinnect the Arduino with a fischertechnik TX Controller? Maybe with IC but i want to use IC for something else on the arduino. So are there multiple IC Ports on the Arduino I havent got one yet? 
1	 I\m working on building my first robotindeed this is my first foray into DIY electronics. I already have a Arduino uno and I have ordered the Tamiya double gearbox here. My goal is to control the gearbox to move the robot but from what I\ve already read I need to have something between the ardunio and the motors. It seems like people have trouble doing that because the included motors are low voltage so the Ardunio motor shield won\t easily work. I\m looking for a clear solution to making this thing run in the simplest way possible. One thing I\m considering is replacing the motors in the gearbox with these motors . If I do that am I right in thinking I could run them from the arduino motor shield? If there is a simpler or cheaper! way of making it work than being stuck on the Arduino Motor shield I\m game for thatI\
1	 Im trying to implement a card reader i.e. credit cards for shopping purposes and AFAIK those cards are ISO 14443-A compliant Mifare Classic 1K. I already made an Android app that can send custom APDU to read specific sectors by using raw SendBytes. Since I need to build a circuit with a custom antenna I chose Arduino-uno with a NFC module was thinking about StrongLink SL013 I wanted to know if its possible to send raw bytes and receive the response from the tag. I only found some higher-level implementation readSector writeSector and so on. 
1	 Goal: I would like to be able to transfer some information to an Arduino Uno board via an NFC shield/antenna. The situation requires that the NFC tag may potentially hit anywhere within a circular area about a 12 inches in diameter. Is it possible to increase the size of an NFC antenna? Possibly creating a loop antenna whereby the tag could be read from anywhere inside the loop. I was thinking maybe if that isnt possible it might be better to create an antenna array spanning the size of the area needed. Though I may have problems with overlap or double reads this way. Has anyone attempted this before? Note: I am not worried about increasing the z distance from the plane just the x/y range. In fact I still want the z distance to be very short as to not interfere with other antennas nearby. 
1	 I want to make a drone project and to that I will use arduino as the platform. My plane is to use a Play Station controller to control the Drone in the air. In addition to that I want to connect a GPS-module. My question goes is it possible to transmit the longitude and latitude from the GPS via the RF 433MHz to the receiver? When received the longitude and latitude how can I transmit them further to the Smartphone and display the data on google maps? I suggest it could be possible through the Xbee but I am not sure. I would like if someone can confirm my idea if not bring me a better way to do that. In the image below you can see the diagram of my design. 
1	 According to this : The Servo library supports up to 12 motors on most Arduino boards and 48 on the Arduino Mega. On boards other than the Mega use of the library disables analogWrite PWM functionality on pins 9 and 10 whether or not there is a Servo on those pins. On the Mega up to 12 servos can be used without interfering with PWM functionality; use of 12 to 23 motors will disable PWM on pins 11 and 12. However according to this : Digital I/O Pins 14 of which 6 provide PWM output So how can the Uno control more than 6 servos if it only has 6 digital I/O pins that can provide PWM output? 
1	 My Arduino UNO board is part of a small robot that works when connected to the laptop by USB but it does not when plugged to the batteries. The baterries plug seems okay it outputs 7.8 V. My UNO is connected to an ArduMoto board that manages the robot motors as well as a bluetooth chip. I have little experience with Arduino or electronics in general so I am stuck on the best course of action. 1 Can I find out what is wrong with the power supply without completely isolating UNO from the robot? 2 If I separate UNO how can I find out with certainty if my UNO power supply is damaged or not? Is there something in particular that I could measure with my multimeter? UPDATE After fully charging my batteries I observed that the LEDs attached to the motor outputs are blinking fast. They blink for about one minute then nothing happens any
1	 I can\t figure out why the next script is not working. I have attached the Arduino to one USB port of the raspberry pi in which I\ve installed pyserial. I just want to turn off/on a led depending of the number I write on the Raspi console 1-> on 2-> off. int led=13;void setup{ Serial.begin115200; pinModeledOUTPUT;}void loop{ ifSerial.available{ modeSerial.read - \0\; }} void modeint n{ if n== 1{ digitalWriteledHIGH; } if n== 2{ digitalWriteledLOW; } } PS: I double checked and the baudrate is configured also at 115200 at the raspi side.In addition if I place digitalWriteledHIGH just before the line modeSerial.read - \0\; the led turn on when I send some information from the raspi shell so works well. 
1	 Im using an Arduino Due with a logic level converter to interface with two different 5v sensors via I2C. Being of poor quality these sensors have no data sheet. When either one of these sensors is plugged in I am able to read from it without issue. The moment I plug the other one in as well the I2C stops working and I just get 0. I know that its not an address collision issue because they have different addresses. I tried adding an additional set of pull-up resistors such that they are in parallel with the built-in ones in order to counteract potentially increased bus capacitance but no dice. What could be causing this issue? I apologise for asking such a noob question. 
1	 I have an Arduino GSM Shield mounted on an Arduino Uno. Can I stack this GPS shield above Arduino GSM shield? Will there be any pin configuration problem? In GSM Shield hardware pins configuraton are as below: 0 - Not connected1 - Not connected2 - GSM Rx3 - GSM Tx7 - Modem reset If there is any problem how can it be solved? I would be happy if there are any alternatives for the GPS shield.

1	 I am communicating with the Web server\s database via Arduino GSM shield + GPRS connectivity void loop { if client.connectserver port { ....... } else { Serial.printlnServer not found; } delay1000; } The first time when the loop runs in the serial port the code works perfectly and stores in my server\s db. The second time when the loop runs after some delay It is unable to connect to the server and results server not found . I don\t know what is the problem. Please let me know if there is a way to connect continuously. Thank you 
1	 So when searching for a way to play audio files through the arduino I came across this site: http://maxoffsky.com/maxoffsky-blog/how-to-play-wav-audio-files-with-arduino-uno-and-microsd-card/ This seems like a really good library although I haven\t had the time to really play around with it yet. Has anyone used this before and if so is it a good library to use or do you know of better ones out there which you would recommend? 
1	 The Xbee requires a 3.3V power input and the Arduino Pro Mini 5V version only provides a regulated 5V. Question: What will be the simplest way to provide a 3.3V rail to the XBee from the Arduino Pro Mini? If we use a voltage divider consisting of 2 resistors the ratio should be 66/100 but how do we choose the resistor values? If we choose a 3.3V voltage regulator will the STMicroelectronics L78L33ACZ be suitable? Between the voltage divider and voltage regulator which is the preferred method? Is there a better alternative? 
1	 I am learning to work with the client - server communication. I am able to communicate with my server and able to store values in the table. But I want to receive one of the specific data from the database. Here I want to get the \abc\ value from the \Current\ column to store in a variable in my arduino. Below are the codes that I have done till now. I would be really happy If you could solve the problem. Here is my database structure --------------------------------------------------- | Device | Previous | Next | Distance | Current| ---------------------------------------------------|katup123| xyz | abc | 2.600 | abc | --------------------------------------------------- Here is my php code locator.php&lt;?php$con=mysqli_connectyour_domain.competerabc123locate;// Check connectionif mysqli_connect_errno {echo Failed to connect to MySQL: . mysqli_co
1	 I am working on reading a text file from the server using http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/GSMClientConnected . It gives me this code: char path[]=/asciilogo.txt I want to store only the contents that are inside the text file to a variable String. But client.read; only reads a single character at a time. Also it takes all the HTTP GET TIME parameters together. How to store only the contents that are present in the text file to a string variable? 
1	 I know that it is possible to connect a stepper motor directly to an arduino as displayed here . I know that another option is to use a motor shield for example the Arduino Motor Shield or the Adafruit Motor Shield . What I would like to know: What are the actual advantages of using a motor shield? Is it just a question of convenience? Or does a motor shield do something that could not easily performed without a shield? Does it allow me to connect more motors than I could connect directly without a shield power supply comes to mind? 
1	 I have an Arduino GSM shield and I plan to purchase an Adafruit GPS shield . The GPS module uses Pin 7 &amp; 8 for Rx and Tx but the GSM shield uses Pin 7 for Modem Reset. Will the overlap on pin 7 affect it in any way? If it does cause issues how can the problem be avoided?

1	 Could I connect a device that requires minimum 5V 1A from the 5V Pin to the Ground and somehow turn it off inside a sketch? edit: I\m using a Due based boad the digix http://digistump.com/wiki/digix/tutorials/basics 
1	 I am working on SMS communication with my phone and Arduino. My intension is simple. When somebody send an SMS the Arduino should read a text file located on my server and forward the content to the same number. The problem here is when I send an SMS to my Arduino which is waiting for my message it does not read my message. But when I separately run this example code I see my SMS is received. It means my SMS is already present in the modem memory. But why does this happen? How to solve this? Here is my code: // libraries#include &lt;GSM.h&gt;// PIN Number#define PINNUMBER // APN data#define GPRS_APN GPRS_APN // replace your GPRS APN#define GPRS_LOGIN login // replace with your GPRS login#define GPRS_PASSWORD password // replace with your GPRS password// initialize the library instanceGSMClient client;GPRS gprs;GSM gsmAccess; GSM_SMS sms;// URL path &amp; port for e
1	 A digital pins output voltage on an UNO board is 5V which is equal to the output from the VCC. I read that the DC current limits of those pins are 40mA and 200mA respectively and that a higher current could damage the board. Now since V=RI I expect to get the same current whether I connect a DC motor to the VCC or to a digital pin. But the motor spins slower when connected to the digital pin. Therefore Im not getting the same current and the only thing I could think of in order to explain this apparent contradiction with ohms law is that there must be some mechanism to keep the current flowing through a digital pin inferior to 40mA. But I also read somewhere cant find/remember the source that there are no such mechanisms except for a fuse concerning the USB... So as you see I cant understand whats going on. It will be really nice if someone could explain that to me... thanks in advance! 
1	 I have a Sparkfun Arduino Pro Micro with an ATmega32u4 on it: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640 and a Roving Networks RN32 Bluetooth Module: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10253 Theoretically I should be able to solder the Rx of the Bluetooth to the Tx on the arduino and vice versa and I should get serial communication over the Bluetooth. Of course I do not. However as a first question: How do I get my arduino to transmit data over the Tx pin? I uploaded this to the arduino with no hiccups: void setup{ Serial.begin9600; } void loop{ Serial.printHelloWurld; } However when I plug up my o-scope I see no signal over the tx line. Nada. I see data coming over the USB into the comm port on my computer but nothing over the tx pin. 
1	 Thank you taking the time to take a look at my question. I have this it\s an UNO modification : https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640 I need to get serial data over the TX pin. How do I do this? Here is my code: void setup{ Serial.begin9600; } void loop{ Serial.printAb; } I should see the A and b spit out over the TX line is this correct? TX should swing from 0 to +5v in this order: 0100 0001 0110 0010. Unfortunately I see nothing coming out of of the TX pin. Mind that I have the USB plugged in and I can see the \Ab\ printed out on the screen in the arduino serial port program. I have also plugged in the UNO into a battery. I again see nothing on the TX pin. My Question: How do I have \Ab\ printed out of the TX pin at a baud of 9600? 
1	 Can somebody explain the below code like how the server understandshow the request goes to the server from the below code. if client.connectserver port { client.printGET /abc.txt; client.println HTTP/1.1; client.printlnHost: www.yourdomain.com; client.printlnUser-Agent: Arduino; client.printlnAccept: text/html; client.printlnConnection: close; client.println; client.stop; } Also is the below lines are necessary ? If yes on what type of situation it would be helpful ? `client.printlnUser-Agent: Arduino; client.printlnAccept: text/html;` How this communication happens? This question is just for understanding purpose? 
1	 Im working on a medium sized robot project with multiple arduinos to control stuff. Ive been planning on using a lead-acid battery pack but then I was given 10 working and identical Asus laptop battery packs rated at 14.8 V 4400 mAh and one old Asus laptop. I opened up one of the battery packs because it was bad and it has a 4S2P battery configuration and a protection board. Can I hook all of these battery packs in parallel or will power leak between the battery packs and is that be a problem? Is there alternatively some 4S20P or 3S25P battery pack with charger I can purchase to put these batteries in? I do have a step-down converter that will provide the Arduinos with the right voltage regardless of input voltage up to 36 V I tried to ask a similar question on electrical engineering but ot was deemed off topic for the site. 
1	 What I am trying to do is to have arduino in low power mode and waking up only when a packet is received and is available to be read from the buffer. A scenario : Zigbee XBee module is not receiving anything arduino is asleep. Once this particular module receives any data from any other module it makes the arduino wake up and process this packet. Ive looked almost everywhere possible about this and people say they do not have a 100% working solution. Does the XBee module produce a particular output on a specific pin when it receives data? If so can I connect that pin to the interrupt enabled pin on arduino and with that interrupt arduino or wake it up?do I need arduino mega for that or is the uno a good enough option? 
1	 I have the Adafruit Motor Shield V2 and an Adafruit stepper motor . I have not soldered the shield onto the Arduino which is an Uno yet because I don\t want to make anything permanent yet. I have the Arduino plugged into a DC wall adapter and have the VIN jumper in the shield and the green power light on the shield is lit. This is how the stepper is connected. As you can see in the picture all the wires from the stepper are plugged in. The order of the wires is what it says it should be on the website which is orange-pink-red-blue-yellow . My sketch\s code is an adapted version of the StepperExample from the Adafruit motor library.

1	 I have Two Arduinos One with the help of sensors it will dynamically updates in to my server database. Other Arduino reads the stored contents from the server database and sends sms to phones. Now I have a text file in my server which updates dynamically for every 5 min - 10 min. I am trying to read that text file contents. I want my server to be always connected So It must be in setup function.I want update only to my text file which dynamically changes so it must be loop function. How to implement this ? Any Suggestion ? 
1	 I\m following the Get Started with Arduino Guidebook and I\m at the part where pulse width modulation PWM is discussed. The instructions say to create a simple circuit with a breadboard red LED arduino connected at pin 9 and ground and a 270 ohm resistor. My power source will be the usb connection. I have a 510 ohm resistor. May I use it instead? In general will using a resistor with a higher resistance than intended in a circuit fry the arduino? Thanks very much for your help. I\m new to arduino and electronic circuits. I have a Uno R3. 
1	 I am currently using an Arduino Mega 2560 with a Windows 8 laptop. On the Arduino I have uploaded the StandardFirmata code with only one modification. The samplingInterval was changed from 19 to 99 as recommended on the Firmata website. I am using the Arduino Library on Processing to communicate with the arduino. The code works but randomly will stop working. On the arduino the RX light will turn off but the TX light continues to blink. I also need to unplug the usb cable for the Processing code to be able to connect again. How do I fix this? Thank you

1	 So I have a project in which an arduino runs on a two cell LiPo battery and I need a fast straight forward way to determine remaining battery charge with an accuracy of 10% so I only have a readout with 10 LEDs on it without using any major extra components so using an external battery charge meter IC is cheating :P. How should I go about this? using arduino mini LiPo is two cells: 74V 150mAh

1	 I would like to have an array of eight 7- and 8-segment LED numerical displays on my Adafruit Trinket.I know that there are some prebuilt arrays of 4 LED\s. So 2 in array would do just fine.However my Adafruit Trinket doesn\t have enough ports for that. I have heard something about connecting it to a small piece of controlling hardware that makes me able to have way less ports in need.What is the appropriate way of connecting a lot of those LED\s on only a few ports on a micro controller? My ideal output would be as follow: 88 88:88:88 or maybe 88 88.88.88So ideally there would be a small space between the first group of 2 digits and the rest.Basically the last 6 digits will represent a time in minutes seconds and hundreds of seconds. 
1	 I have come across some Andruino Sensors like Motion Light and all recommend to be connected to pin 2 or 3 on Andruino Uno board which are interrupt pins. This is especially true if you are looking for HIGH or LOW values. Why is that to be connected to interrupt pins? One example would be is I used CC3000 Wifi Breakout and Motion sensor. Both were in fight to occupy the interrupt pin 2. I have seen the Motion sesnor not working correctly after getting its signal hooked to Pin 4[It has pull up resistor enabled] What should I do if i need to hook up more sensor which uses the limited interrupt pins and how should i handle the above scenario? 
1	 Problem: Have an LED strip do some animation say it takes 15 seconds for that line of code to run meanwhile have a sensor tried methods: PIR sensor and ultrasonic sensor watching to see if an object passes by. If it senses an object stop the light animation and make the lights do something else. Issues: The PIR sensor takes too long to reset... I have the timing turned all the way to minimum and I am still able to count 12 seconds before it starts sensing motion again. Is there anyway to override this in the code? The other issue is the ultrasonic sensor as far as I know cant reliably run the first animation and watch for a change in distance then call an interrupt since an interrupt can only happen on FALLING RISING LOW or CHANGE. This is an issue because the ultrasonic sensor is continuously sending LOW to HIGH then back to LOW for its pulses. OVERALL QUESTION: How can I effectively sense if an object passes by a sensor run new LED animation then back

1	 I have an Arduino Micro and an MPU6050 gyro/accelerometer board; I want to read DMP data from the MPU6050 but the sketch requires the use of the interrupt pin of which I have none of the interrupt pins available and they cannot be switched around.

1	 I want to power a small motor with a 9V battery and control it with PWM using an Arduino Leonardo. I know I can power the motor separately but this introduces the problem of needing a battery to power the motor 9V battery and another power source to power the Arduino another 9V battery? Would it be safe to simply power the Arduino with a 9V battery and use the Vin pin on the board which is unregulated and outputs directly the power source powering the Arduino to drive the motor? That way I power everything from the 9V battery and use a transistor to drive the motor. Thanks a lot! Steve. 
1	 Does anyone know how the data in data packet looks like when the USB is initialized as COM port? I have a Arduino Mega 2560. I have initialized COM port with a baud rate of 9600. I know that there are four types of USB packets as Token Packet Commonly used for device identification and transaction initiation. Data Packet Contains the data that needs to be transferred from host to client or vice-versa. Acknowledgement Packet Acknowledgement for error-free data reception. Special Packets Hub to hub communication and speed differential. The payload in data packet is formatted as DATA1 >> PAYLOAD >> CRC16 ; DATA2 >> >> PAYLOAD >> CRC16 ; etc. Till this point I am clear about whats happening. Now all I want to know is How the data is structured in the PAYLOAD section when USB is initialized as COM port? How the baud rate comes into picture i.e how a particular baudrate
1	 I have two NRF24L01+ modules which are transceivers but for my project I would like to send a very simple signal from one of these modules to the be read by the other. That would\ve been very simple if I had an Arduino on each side but due to power consumption constraints as well as size cost and practicality the transmitting side won\t have one. Would it still be possible to do this? To clarify the message itself is not important and can be set in stone it will never change. I really just want to detect on the receiving side which will have an Arduino that the transmitter is in fact transmitting. Transmission will be triggered by a push-button. Ideally I would have a way of identifying my particular transmitter from others on similar frequencies but I am not too precious about that. 
1	 I followed a tutorial on how to setup arduino and bluetooth so it can be programmed without usb cables. I didn\t use capacitors or resistors asthere doesn\t seem to be a need for them. I have the serial output appearing on arduino serial console via bluetooth no usb cable connected. Since the is a working connection that means it is working to a point. However when trying to upload I get avrdude: stk500_getsync: not in sync: resp=0x4c error. I didn\t connect pin 32 of hc-05 to arduino reset pin yet could that be the issue? I don\t actually need arduino to be reset since I can just kill the power to it manually at least for now. I also used 9600 as baud rate instead of 115200 as in the tutorial because my arduino code used 9600 but maybe I misunderstood this and it actually needs to be 115200 regardless or my baud rate in arduino code? What else could be the cause?<
1	 Id like to know which is the most powerful lightest and perhaps least expensive micro controller capable of running Arduino. 
1	 I am new to Raspberry Pi just brought mine before writing this post and I am looking to see what is the most ideal way for two way communication between an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi USB SPI or I2C. The reason I am asking is because I need to build a small semi-autonomous robot and plan on using both the Arduino and Pi to control it using the pins of the Arduino for the motor control and sensors and the Pi for video processing and autonomous part. Both will be on the robot itself. I am pretty good with the Arduino but never used a Raspberry Pi before. So my biggest question is what would be the best form of communication for the two boards taking into account speed and safety there is a voltage difference between the Pi and the Arduino.

1	 in the below Fritzing diagram I have a button that has a pull-up resistor which when pressed sets the GPIO Pin 23 to HIGH. On the Raspberry Pi when the button is released the GPIO goes LOW. The Raspberry Pi detects when the button is released and pressed. This is my desired behavior. However in my current configuration I have PIN 13 connected to the Base of a NPN transistor to try to simulate the same behavior as the button with a pull-up resistor. When pin 13 is set to high it sets the GPIO 22 Pin to high. When I set the Arduino Pin 13 to low The GPIO Pin goes low but the Raspberry PI does not detect that GPIO 22 pin went low. Is there a way to simulate the same behavior as a button with a pull-up resistor with an OUTPUT pin from the arduino? 
1	 Im using an Arduino Leonardo to interface with two pressure sensors and Python on my laptop a MackBook Pro. Im using arduino IDE V. 1.5.4 Python V. 2.7.6 and OSX 10.8.5. One pressure sensor is digital using the Wire lib and the other is analog. My sketch compiles runs and works until I try to get the data in Python using pyserial. If I try to grab a bunch of data using the readlines method in the scrip it will only return blank data or hang depending on the serial object timeout settings. My python code sometimes works from the repl when I initialize the serial object and wait before reading from it. If I dont wait the serial object will only partially fill a list and then any future reads will return an empty string. This continues even after closing the serial object and reopening it in Python or closing the serial object in Python and then opening the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE. Once the serial port stops sending I have to reset

1	 Ive got a cmps10 compass module hooked up to my arduino due through a logic level converter. I am writing code to convert the raw magnetometer readings into a bearing that I can use but have run into a huge problem. My bearings are all funky for some reason. They are totally unrelated to the actual bearing of the robot. I know the sensor is fine because I am able to get the tilt compensated reading from it and it works great. One thing I noticed is that the magnetometer reading on the X-axis is always positive could this be the problem? The X-axis high byte generally between 0x00 and 0x03.

1	 I am planning to connect multiple Arduinos to my Raspberry Pi. There are basically two ways I can achieve that: Use an USB hub. Each Arduino will then be available through ordinary serial commands both for reading and writing. The USB hub I have is powered and can handle both communications and powering the Arduinos. Use I2C so that the Arduinos are I2C slaves of the Raspberry Pi. Since USB is used for updating the Arduino I don\t have the best feeling about using this same connection for management tasks. Are there any known disadvantages to using the pre built USB socket onthe Arduino in production any best practises or similar saying that I should not dothis? Is this USB socket meant to be used for debugging and code deployment only? The plan is to let the computer send commands to the Arduinos using a serial protocol. The computer will automatically detect whenever an Arduino is connected and immedi
1	 From the Capacitive Sensor Page on the Arduino website it states the following: The capacitiveSensor method toggles a microcontroller send pin to a new state and then waits for the receive pin to change to the same state as the send pin. A variable is incremented inside a while loop to time the receive pin\s state change. The method then reports the variable\s value which is in arbitrary units. AND Use a 1 megohm resistor or less maybe for absolute touch to activate. With a 10 megohm resistor the sensor will start to respond 4-6 inches away. With a 40 megohm resistor the sensor will start to respond 12-24 inches away dependent on the foil size... However as mentioned above what I\m measuring is the time taken to change state and I understand that more resistance = more time taken = higher value how
1	 Im new to Arduino and I saw on there website that there are many different kinds of boards.What are the differences or to be more specific how would I know which board is meet my requirements? I understand that the shields can be connected to the board but are some boards that do not support certain shields? Another thing is it possible to connect external sensors to an Ardunio board or there are special sensors that can communicate with the board? I want to use weight sensors. 
1	 Is it possible to connect the nine pins from a USB 3.0 memory drive to the corresponding GPIO pins of the arduino intel Galileo is what I am using but it is very similar and access the drives memory through the implementation of the USBs protocol? I have searched around and have not been able to get a clear idea on how to do this or if it is even possible. 
1	 I think the answer is yes but I wanted to ask the question anyway for future common reference. And to check my understanding. Say I want to power 10 LEDs with PWM with my Mega 2560. I have a bunch of 200 ohm resistors. I know the Mega and most other Arduinos can safely provide a maximum of 200mA total current. 200mA / 10 is 20mA per LED maximum. Using my 200 ohm resistors I can calculate how much voltage will supply 20 mA of current: V = 200 ohms * 20mAV = 4V So I just need to make sure to analogWrite less than or equal to 4V to each of the ten LEDs and I wont cross the 200mA threshold. Thats if PWM was true analog. However PWM is not true analog and if I analogWrite 4V to each pin theyre going to spend most of the time at 5V and some of the time at 0V. When every pin is at 5V the board has to supply 5V / 200 ohms * 10 = 250mA Which is over the spec so I am in danger of damaging my boar
1	 I am looking to possibly monitor battery power to the Arduino using its ADC. This is fairly straight forward and simple especially if using the Arduino API; however if the battery is powering the Arduino and is unregulated externally wont the ADC reference voltage constantly be dropping with the battery? In other words wouldnt the ADC value would constantly read the same value the max value even though the battery would actually be decreasing in voltage? If this is the case it would be both inefficient and pointless to measure the battery voltage. 
1	 So ive worked with the pySerial module for python where I communicated with my arduino via serial. However this module only works for 32bits and I would like to make my project work on both architectures I know the person could just install the 32-bits version on the 64-bits architecture. Also the connection fails a lot of times and I wasnt able to correct it. I think I can use the true USB power of the arduino Leonardo to connect to the python in a different way but I dont know where to start. But I think this approach will be more professional. Im really intersted in learning so if you guys could at least indicate documents so I can understand how to make this connection between Leonardo and Python Ill be happy. Ive read the arduino page about the CDC but couldnt find useful information. Thank you so much. Update: When i used serial I had problems with messages getting acumulated at the buffer and then after some seconds i was reading 1
1	 I am currently tinkering with an arduino and am using a potentiometer to change the brightness of an LED. I understand that usually a resistor is added to the circuit to limit the current flowing through the circuit in order to prevent the LED from burning out. However as I am currently using a potentiometer to adjust the LEDs brightness AND as a potentiometer is basically a variable resistor would I still need a resistor to prevent the LED from burning out? Currently I do not see a difference between using a 220 ohm resistor and not using it as the LED seems unaffected. My code: const int pot=A0;const int led=11;int potValue;void setup{ Serial.begin9600; pinModepotINPUT; pinModeledOUTPUT; analogWriteled100;}void loop{ potValue = analogReadpot; potValue=mappotValue010230255; analogWriteledpotValue; Serial.printlnpotValue;} PS: My LED is hooked up to the arduinos PWM pin and
1	 Altough having found a lot of documentation concerning wiring of IC buses Im still not sure about the following question: If both devices use separate power sources is it a good idea to connect VCC/GND of those two devices? I have two lines for SCL and SDA connected to SCL/SDA pins on both devices A and B. The master devices VCC is connected to both lines using a pull-up resistor. Now as far as I understood VCC/GND of the two devices should not be disconnected but Im afraid Id damage something if Id connect them. As two separate power sources will never provide exactly the same voltage that would result in high currents wont it? Or should I just connect them using some resistor to avoid high currents but provide the same voltage level?

1	 I am using Arduino GSM Shield receiving SMS from an Android app. And the content of this SMS will control a LED. If the content of this SMS is not off the LED will be on and the content will be printed in the serial monitor. But if it is off the LED will be off immediately. Besides the LED will keep being on until the off message coming. For now I used the code from the example of the software. But I cannot use the content of this SMS to control the status of LED. With the code below the LED could not be turned on and the content could not be displayed on the monitor. I think it was because the sketch failed to get the whole content of this SMS.

1	 I would like to use multiple three serial ports on an Arduino Due. Instead of polling the ports continuously I would like to use a Serial.Event function for each of the ports. These handler functions will read out the incoming string from the port and parse the string i.e. check for a pre-defined command and call a corresponding sub-routine. I was wondering what is going to happen when serial data arrives at the same time at two different ports? For example if the program is in the process of handling/parsing the first serial message will it interrupt/abandon this process as soon as another SerialEvent on another port is triggered? Or will it complete the first SerialEvent routine before going to the second one?

1	 I have an analog electricity meter AEM and I would like to track my usage of electricity.I\ve attempted to use the EE-SY310 photo sensor but that\s not sensitive enough it seems. I suspect the black stripe on the dial is too thin to be picked up. The other concern on using any photo sensor is its dependance on light obviously hence no reading would be picked up during the night. Other: I\ve also found that AEMs work by using magnetic fields to move the dial. The magnetic field detector I used did not show much fluctuation when turning appliances on/off. The dial was pegged at the max. Therefore I\m not so confident that a sensor to measure magnetic fields would work here but I\m open to suggestions.

From what Ive seen class-1 bluetooth adapters go for ~60$ two xbee modules + usb adapter end up costing even more and wifi solutions seem to reside in the same price range. At that price point it seems better to get a raspberry pi wifi dongle and a couple beers for the software re-write. Am I overlooking some solution? 
1	 So before starting to learn with something else Ill give it one last try. The avrdude is complaining that the device signature doesnt match. Whatever I dont care. To me whats written on it is what counts. So Id like to force it to upload the program. It promises to ignore the problem if -F is specified. Where are settings for avrdude parameters like other IDEs have settings for their compilers? 
1	 Im trying to create an app for my science fair that uses bluetooth to track people in a determined place.I was thinking about one Arduino system to receive all the information and transmit through a network and some Arduino slaves to duplicate the signal and cover the hole place. Resuming... Ill have: Arduino slaves placed all over the place to track people One Arduino connected to the network to receive all the information from the slaves and pass it through the network. Some kind of web app inside the main Arduino with an API to manage the data and make it friendly for third-party apps I was wondering of what kind of equipment should I buy to make this happen. Thanks! Each cellphone with its bluetooth enabled will work as a person sending signal - my Arduino slaves will receive the signal find bluetooth around it and send the device name and signal strength to the arduino master - The arduino mast
1	 I have an Adaruit Motor Shield v2 and a Tower Pro SG92R micro servo . I\ve got it setup so the shield works with my Arduino Uno and I\ve successfully tested using other types of motors on the shield. I could not find any sample code for working with a servomotor though. The shield has two dedicated spots for a servo labeled Servo 1 and Servo 2. I\m planning to use wall wart transformer to power the motor separately from the Arduino. Any pointers/links to documentation/sample code would be appreciated. 
1	 I used the GSM library that comes together with arduino 1.Specifically the sendSMS part. I managed sucesfully to send SMS. Now the thing is inside this library the SMS to send is stored in a char variable: char txtMsg[200]; My question is are you able to send the SMS but store the message not in a char variable but as a String? I would test it myself but now i only have one SIM card and for some reason my network is blocking it that is another thread to be started btw 
1	 I wanted to save some values to the EEPROM and also wanted to free up SRAM by avoiding some variable declarations but EEPROM memory is byte wise. If I want to store an int value I have to use some expressions repeatedly. I thought I would make some functions for those. But I am concerned that if I create a function it would still occupy SRAM memory better I declare an int variable instead of using EEPROM. How are the functions and the local variables stored in SRAM? Does it only store the address of the fuction pointer from the flash memory or all the variables and commands are stored on the stack? 
1	 I\m trying to test the maximum speed at which I can send data to a 328P based Arduino using a USB to Serial converter like the FT232RL or the ATMega16u2 that is used on the Uno. I\ve borrowed some code from here: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/benchmark_usb_serial_receive.html I\m using his receive_test code on Windows to test what I can achieve in terms of sending data to the arduino for the sake of using it to control LED strips. On the Arduino side I\m testing with the following: static int count = 0;unsigned char data = 0;int led = 13;// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:void setup { //UART Initialisation UCSR0A |= 1&lt;&lt;U2X0; UCSR0B |= 1&lt;&lt;RXEN0 | 1&lt;&lt;TXEN0 | 1&lt;&lt;RXCIE0; UCSR0C |= 1&lt;&lt;UCSZ01 | 1&lt;&lt;UCSZ00 ; UBRR0H = 0; UBRR0L = 3; //Baud Rate 0.5 MBi

1	 I need to use a motor shield and an LCD keypad shield simultaneously hooked up to a single Arduino Mega Board. Since I cant physically stack them I decided to reroute all the pins used for the LCD keypad shield. When I reroute all pins except the two power pins the LCD and keypad work fine. But when I disconnect those 2 pins and connect them to any other power source than the Arduino Mega it fails. The screen becomes either blank / jumble of illegible characters / brief moments of expected output followed by the same jumble. This behavior is really strange since the power pins dont carry any information they are just power sources. The LCD keypad shield shouldnt be able to discriminate whether the power is coming from the Arduino Mega or not - but it does. I checked with a voltmeter that all power sources I tried are DC 5V. At first I thought this is because the lcd.begin function is called only once so I rewrote my code to re-in

1	 I want to wire Arduino Due connectors to a breadboard 8-at-a-time so they\re easier to remove and more reliable. I tried these Flat Flex Cable Assemblies FFC assemblies terminated with solder lugs from Digi-Key but the pins are just a little too short to penetrate the Arduino connectors well. Similarly they barely reach into to the breadboard contacts so they tend to fall out. Anyone find a workable product for this? This solution is good but requires a lot of manual soldering. Looking for prepackaged. 
1	 Im developing a system that will get the GPS signal and send it though the GSM with information about position speed and temperature from some digital sensors. Currently Im using the GPS EM408 the Arduino mega plus the GSM board official one. The problem is that the GPS by the library TinyGPSPlus gives me the same speed for long time or sometimes give me 0km/h. The sketch works like this: loop{ getGPSData - ~ 1 sec to execute and take one data from the GPS. getSensors - ~ 1 sec to execute and take one data from the digital sensors. sendData - ~ 6 n 10 secs to send the data through the internet. } The whole process takes around 10 ~ 15 secs to be completed. If I remove the sendData and the system starts getting the GPS information each second the speed value works perfectly but if I get the data from the GPS each 12 secs because of the GSM delay the speed doesnt work as expected. I understand that t

1	 Ive got a question regarding the use of Millis on a Leonardo Arduino. Im currently using it to time 4 seconds elapsed while sending a serial message every second. These messages play a sound. On the fourth message the sound is different to signify that the Arduino has started an event. Im running into an issue where the sounds are occasionally being played sporadically without a consistent 1 second between them. Im wondering if there is a better way of doing what Im doing? During the timing the Arduino is doing nothing else and the receiving computer is also generally not doing anything taxing. Is this even an issue from the Arduino side? My receiving program is written in C# using System.IO.Ports.SerialPort. The reason this is done through Arduino is because the event started by the Arduino needs to correspond exactly to the sounds though if this remains unresolved I will need to rework this. Edit: Code as requested. vo
1	 I need to communicate my arduino by bluetooth but Im living in a small town recently so I cant buy a bluetooth shield for my arduino. Here is my question: Can I use a usb bluetooth dongle on my Arduino without a shield? PS: There is no need to re-use that bluetooth dongle with usb again. 
1	 UPDATE: The issue turned out to be with my work laptop. Our IT department has them configured in such a way that the assignment of serial ports is different somehow.

1	 I know the arduino is a nice quick and dirty prototyping board. You quickly test your idea and if you want to proceed you can do so with AVRs. Your options is1. Upload the program to Arduino then remove the AVR chip and make a pcb with the bootloader2. Start from scratch with AVR not always feasible because many libs are in arduino Now what is the purpose of a system that has processors that cannot be removed? For example the arduino Galileo. Sure you can do many things with it but bottom line you cannot remove the processor and do something with it. As an example imagine you are prototyping a system you wish to then market and sell. Taht is feasible with the arduino Uno family. But what if you did in in Galileo? Even if it worked you couldnt sell your system because you rely on the prototyping board. You cannot remove the processor. Am i missing something?

In later Projects I want to display values on it and refresh them in a 1 - 1/2 second clock. Is that still possible? If I would use SPI I have to solder the 3 connections on the bottom of the board to make it work can I still use 8-bit mode afterwards?

1	 I\m fairly new to this and I need some help before I buy anything... If I understand correctly I can buy an arduino couple of shields and just stack them one onto another if they are compatible... I\ll be doing some work with an arduino and I would need both WiFi and GSM shields but I\m not sure if they\re compatible... On the arduino.cc I saw that they both use pin 7 GSM as modem reset and WiFi as handshake Is there any way I can use both of the shields even though they use the same pin? Thanks 
1	 Ive been programming and testing an Arduino based quadcopter for the past 4 months. Until now I did not need to use an external power source for my sensors. Now I want to use the BEC power from my electronics speed controllers. Each of the 4 ESCs gives 5V @ 2A. I would set these up in a parallel circuit which would give me 5V @ 8A theoretically. I also want to use a cheap chinese voltage sensor to sense the voltage from my 5000mAh 25-50c 11.1v battery. Im not sure if it is safe to connect my batteries wires to my sensor with the 125A that it can put out. My question is whether or not it is safe to have a common ground on Arduino with an 8A power supply AND if it is safe to use a 5V 8A power supply with these sensors. Here is a problem that Ive encountered before: while powering my IMU off the BEC and sending motor PWM signals my sketch would run for about 10 seconds then freeze. It was not until I powered my IMU off the Arduinos 5V power that I

1	 I\ve recently ordered an Arduino Yun and several other components to begin on a small robotics project based on an old 4x4 RC Truck. Although not mandatory for what I\d like to do I was wondering how feasible it would be to mount a small camera or two and write some software for the Linux portion of the Yun to do basic image/video analysis such as face detection and computer vision based path finding? Mostly this is a question about the processing power capabilities of the Yun. Has anyone had any luck doing simple image analysis/recognition on this processor? Also if anyone with 150+ rep could edit this to create and add the computer-vision tag that would be great

1	 Ive just received my Uno today and already I think I may have broken it : I was able to connect to usb and upload a sketch the blink. However I then tried to connect a circuit to do the Hello World LCD example. After trying this a few times I noticed the LCD chip get very hot...and I had mis-wired it. In any case after a few more tries the USB connection to my Arduino UNO stopped working. I tried swapping the cable connecting it to another mac and to a windows with no luck. Im worried I may have shorted the USB bus chip when trying Hello World. I also tried connecting a 12V DC power supply. I still get the green power light and the amber L light...Did I break my Uno?How do I troubleshoot this one?thanks 
1	 When the Leonardo was introduced I think I\ve read some articles about being cautious to do some things that could cause it to not load any new sketches any more so one has to rewrite the bootloader. Because I plan to use power-saving options e.g. to disable unused hardware components like USB port I fear to do something wrong. One Leonardo-delicacy I\ve found so far: if interrupts are disabled uploading new sketches fails unless one presses the Reset button as soon as the Arduino IDE is showing Uploading... What stuff except of the usual hardware-related thinks like connecting output-configured pins to fixed potentials could damage the controller or require to reflash the Leonardo with a fresh bootloader? 
1	 Ive got an SD card and speaker hooked up to my nano and I can play mono audio files easily. My question is is it possible to control the speed of a motor using the pwm output to the speaker? I tried just hooking the motor in where the speaker was but that produced no noticeable variations in speed. Alternatively is it possible to analyse the wav file on the nano and control the motor that way? i.e. motor speed is dependant on volume at a given time Thanks

1	 I am working on Fall Detection in humans. A system that would raise alarm when a person falls. For this I plan to use acceleration to see if it is a fall and orientation change to reduce false positives. I was trying to get angle of orientation using gyroscopeaccelerometer and magnetometer. According to what I have googled I shouldnt use gyroscope alone as when we integrate to get angle the result is not accurate and I should use sensor fusion and filter using kalman filter or complementary filter. I cant use accelerometer as during a fall the acceleration wont be only from gravity. I am a newbie so I dont know how to proceed. Correct me if I have understood anything wrong till now. 
1	 I am working on a human fall detection system using accelerometer and gyroscope which raises alarm in case of a fall. In all the papers I have read people have used net acceleration magnitude and compared it with a threshold and coupled it with change in orientation to detect fall. My question is would it be better to use acceleration in z-axisnormal to earth\s surface and compare it to threshold as compared to net acceleration as it might reduce false positives as net acceleration can exceed threshold in case of running but that won\t happen if i take only acceleration in z-axis. Is my approach right? How can I implement sensor fusion using a gyroscope and a magnetometer to find the orientation?

1	 The arduino website states that the operating voltage of an arduino is 7-12V. Why does the arduino work powered on just usb then? As usb only outputs 5V and 500ma. Is it preferable to say run the arduino on an external 9V dc power source or does it make no difference?

1	 I want to write a lipoly powered arduino device that can be launched from sleep mode by pressing a certain key that is connected to ground. Usually when no in sleep mode I enable the internal pull-up resistor for a definite level. But when in sleep mode I assume this would drain to much power and hence I want to avoid it. Is it sufficient to just wait for a pin-change interrupt on the same port pin without the internal or an additional external pull-up resistor? 
1	 Ive got 2 int16_t numbers say 388 and 10288 which are sensor readings from an accelerometer. I want to estimate the angle of the device on that but seemingly there are some type overflow issues: My final goal is this: theta = atan-ax/sqrtfloatay*ay+az*az; The problem occurs in the bracket: ay^2 and az^2 are the 2 power of the given numbers. I recalculated with matlab and for the above example I get a^2+b^2 = 388^2+10288^2 = 105993488 what I get from the arduino however is 152848 .To be short: I dont know much about fixed point math or thelike and I couldnt find a sufficient answer to this: How do I calculate the square root term?

1	 I have a sketch to display a temperature obtained from 1-wire DS18B20 sensors. The sketch works fine however when I connect two sensors to my board the text on the LCD displays gets corrupted ### and other symbols shown instead of a temperature. I have tried plugging each of the two DS18B20 sensors individually and it works with both of them the problem shows only when I use both at the same time. I am connecting them both with black to ground red to 5V and white to Dx and to 5V via a 4.7 kOhm pull-up resistor. I have little idea how to check what is wrong - is it some kind of interference insufficient voltage or a SW problem? 
1	 This is something I\m struggling with for a while and fail to find solid solution.The Arduino IR library provides method for recording arbitrary IR code and re-sending it.

1	 I started my first try in programming an ATTINY13 with my Arduino 2560. Everything seemed fine however when I wanted to run the blink example my LED did not blink it keeps lighting. I am using 5V as input voltage. I did not change the blink example except for the correct pin number. All the wiring seems correct when I change the pin number the LED stays dark so my program is arriving propperly on the ATTINY. If I start playing with the delays delaymicroseconds I get the LED to become darker. The documentation of the ATTINY13 www.atmel.com/images/doc2535.pdf mentions a maximum clock frequency of 20MHz. When I choose the ATTINY13 from the Arduino IDE board menu it is listed with a 9.6MHz clock. Could this be a reason?How can I adjust or take care of that? ----------- Edit: I was starting with the default blink example delay1000 . I played with both the normal delay and the delayMic

1	 I am new to the microcontroller world and circuits so bare with me. I recently bought some 5V arduino pro mini microcontrollers. I have been playing with them and they work fine I have been powering it from an usb connection. Now I want to power the board using a 9V battery I connected the + to the RAW pin and the Ground to the Ground pin on the Arduino. My question is if I can still use the VCC pins? I understand the board has a voltage regulator that from my understanding it brings down the 9V to 5V. I thought this 5 volts were available through the VCC pin but I connected an LED to it and nothing happens. I have tried this method with an arduino Uno and it works so I dont know why it doesnt work with the Pro Mini. 
1	 I read few posts and tutorials on this topic but none of them kind of answered my questions. I bought this L298N motor board and i have two motors that are rated 3V Now i am trying to understand how to connect it to arduino and power the motors. For example i have a 12V 8x 1.5v AA batteries I can connect to VCC and GND then enable ENA with a jumper and connect PWN port from arduino to INA. This way i can control the voltage that is coming out from OUTA and OUTB I can bring down the 12V to 3V. Now the question is can i use the +5 regulated voltage on the driver board and connect it to arduino Vin and GND to ground to power the arduino? Is that viable solution. I actually tried it and it works. I am worried that it is not enough voltage to properly power the arduino. It\s suggested to connect 7v - 12v to Vin. I am also going to connect a red lab ble shield on top of arduino that is p
1	 I am looking into using the SerialIP library to connect my Arduino to the internet through it\s USB connection to my computer. However I cannot figure out how to establish the SLIP connection to the Arduino from my Mac. The library\s documentation says: Perhaps the most difficult part of using this library is figuring out how to establish the SLIP connection to the Arduino. It suggests the use of: sudo slattach -L -s 115200 -p slip /dev/ttyUSB0 On linux systems. However on my Mac running OS X 10.10 there is no such command. I ran into this thread on the Apple forums regarding the missing slattach command which sounds like it was removed in OS X 10.6. How can I use the SerialIP Arduino library on my Mac? 
1	 Yesterday afternoon I have left my Arduino running on a fresh Alkaline 9V battery + connected to Vin - connected to GND. Today morning 16 hours later the LCD display was no longer visible and when I measured the volatage I saw the battery was depleted to my surprise - its idle voltage was only 7 V. My device is Arduino Uno with LCD 2x16 with LCD backlight and 2 DS18B20 sensors. Is it normal for such device to deplete 9V battery this quick? I have read an answer to What are or how do I use the power saving options of the Arduino to extend battery life? question and I think what I see might be related to this however I am not sure. If it is is there some common schematics how to connect Arduino to be powered by a battery efficiently?

1	 I am working with a Sainsmart Uno with SVG header pins . This header is really convenient for hooking a servo to directly so I have two servos connected to it on D9 and D10 and a 9v battery supplying power via the power jack. Everything seems to work fine at first but eventually sometimes quickly the board becomes unresponsive. If instead I wire my servos to use the 5v pin on the Arduino not from this SVG header I don\t run into this trouble. Does anyone know if I am running into a limitation of this header Voltage pin? Has anyone had any success using this mechanism to drive servos? Certainly I don\t NEED to do it this way but it sure is convenient. 
1	 I found this wonderful breakout board based on FT232 . I wonder if I can use this board for connecting my arduino to a USB dongle for 3g/GPRS connection ? From what I understand this board can be connected to the serial data pins of the arduino board. And if I connect the USB dongle to the FT232 board I should be able to run AT commands from the arduino board.

Is the MOSFET even necessary? It seems backlight is drawing about 5 mA - can I perhaps drive it directly from the D9 pin using the resistor? It seems another user in Do I need to use a resistor if I am using a potentiometer to control an LED&#39;s brightness? is controlling brightness without any of those.

1	 I\m designing an Arduino style board with built-in LEDs for several of the pins. To simplify assembly of the board and save on components I was wondering whether it would be safe for those LEDs to share a single resistor as in this diagram: Obviously the power dissipated through the resistor 3mA per pin @ 3V is not a real problem. The reason I was hesitating is that LEDs in a parallel configuration should not share resistors but is it safe to think that separate microcontroller pins don\t count as a common anode even if both pins are high?

Many web posting are along the line of getting it partially working but only at half expected current reduction etc. That is current do reduced but not enough. Are there several such library? How are they? Which one is better support and more functions? no need for easy to use can do registers programming when needed Many thanks in advance 
1	 In context of Pro Mini and ATMega2560 Fuses as documented in chip factory doc are complex topics I have not really used it before appreciate pointers and advises to narrow down those that are needed for contexted task and left un-needed in their default modes. Which fuses are used within context of the IDE in general and in specific of software loading via bootloader and ISP? Which fuses related to sleep and power down modes in context that individual chip modules can be set to various power-saving modes via registers. Does fuses play a part in getting the power-saving effect? Many thanks in advance

1	 I have my Arduino Yun set up with a web server. The webpage has a series of buttons on it which control the buzzer playing various sounds and a button to control a stepper motor . I\m using the code linked which uses the AccelStepper library. The button works fine for the buzzer I click it and it plays the sound. For the motor however I click the button and the LED lights up on the driver board for a second after the button is clicked but that\s it. I suspect that the motor unlike the buzzer needs the command to be true all the time while it moves to it\s position otherwise it stops. So the button on the webpage needs to act more like a switch - click to come on and stay on click again to go off and stay off. But I\m unsure how to do this. Or else perhaps anyone has experience with this stepper motor and knows how to use it without accelstep

But occasionally it will report the time as 165 hours 85 minutes and 25 seconds 165:85:25 for a couple of seconds then go back to the correct time.

Can someone explain why I should or should not use PWM signal when controlling a motor? 
1	 I need to measure around 50 - 100 analog sensors resistors. This poses two challenges: Arduino has fewer analog pins. I\m targeting something small like arduino Mini or Nano which can have up to 8 analog pins. The solution for this could be several multiplexors like this one . Is there a better option? Is this the best way to read so many analog sensors with Arduino? I am thinking also in several arduino mini talking through wifi / bluetooth with the main one which would also aid with Problem #2.

Instructables has a good lesson on this: http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-access-5-buttons-through-1-Arduino-input/?ALLSTEPS My requirement is that I need to attach an interrupt to buttons ie the analog input before reading the analog value so that all the buttons can act as a trigger. This works for voltages in the higher range but not in the lower range the trigger input waits for a RISING edge. Can any one suggest a circuit that steps a >0V+ to +5V input to a +5V output so that any button push would trigger the input? Otherwise does anyone have other suggestions on how to use triggers for each button?

1	 I am trying to figure out how to build a system of devices that could on command notify similar devices that are within a configurable distance. Maximum ranges would need to be around 20 though up to 40 would be preferable. Accuracy +- 20% is acceptable as is degradation due to things such as large intervening objects walls buildings etc. Only one notification is expected in any given 10 second block. I was thinking the sending device could send a ultrasonic ping and then send a data packet with the ping time stamp and range notification to all devices in range. And then each receiver could compare the ping receive time and range notification and calculate if it is within the range given in the data packet. Would this work? Is there a better way to do this?

1	 Im setting up a grid of 200+ slave modules which will be about 12 inches apart and the master will be anywhere from 5 to 10 meters away from the closest module. Each slave module will have a ATtiny85 to manage the sensor reading LEDs and the network protocol. The communication packets will be small and will probably be at 115200 baud if using ATTiny85s TTL serial or 1MHz if using SPI. In either case the modules will be connected in a daisy chain to each other. Each module will have a resistive touch sensor and be driving about 12 - 16 RGB LEDs Im making a step responsive disco dance floor. There will be 12v+ running to each module to drive the LEDs and regulated down to 5V for the ATtiny. Which brings me to my question. With these constraints do you think the ATtiny85s built-in serial or SPI would still work well over the 5 to 10 meters from the closest module to the master. I know some people push towards RS422 or RS485 transceivers for distance app

1	 Ive programmed the arduino uno to generate pwm corresponding to the serial input values. And it works fine with led. I took the connection from pwm pin 3 where I set the output to the base of a bc548 transistor and connected the motor in series with external motor power supplyvcc and the collector and the emmitter is groundedto both arduinos gnd pin and the external supplys. The motor had a fly wheel diode 4n4007 and a capacitor of 1uf for protection. But when I connect the motor and provide with the pwm input it works for a few seconds and then I saw a few flashes in the rx and tx leds and it stops working even with a serial input or reset. I need to turn it off and then on to make it work again. Same thing repeats when I connect the motor but it works fine with an led. How can I fix that?? 
1	 I\m trying to build a small personal weather station. The rain sensor and wind speed sensor use interrupts. The barometric sensor uses i2c SDA and SCL. Reading the Arduino Yun manual it says there are 5 interrupt pins but 2 of them are SCL/SDA pins D2 and D3 and 2 of them are serial comms between Linio and the 32U4 pins 0 and 1. This leaves me with 1 interrupt pin left pin 7. Is there a work around to get my 2 digital sensors AND SDA SCL pins connected? If I do use pins 0 and 1 Linux serial what do I risk? I will need to use the Bridge to relay information to the internet. 
1	 I am trying to build a 36-line cable tester using the Digistump DigiX 99 i/o pins. Digital pins 0-35 are outputs connected via the cable in question to in a perfect world digital input pins 36-72. The plan is to have 36 neopixels to conserve DigiX pins one corresponding to each line in the cable. Currently they light up green for connection and red for no connection. It\s easy to check if output 0 goes to input 36 but there are more potential problems in a cable than no connection... What if there is a short and output 0 goes to 36 and 42? It will still show up as correct when it tests 0 to 36... I somehow need to ask it what if any inputs pins 36-72 are HIGH when only output 0 is HIGH. I\m not sure how I\m going to display this extra data yet Lcd maybe? Or maybe any pins shorted together all use a unique led color... but I want to make sure the idea will work before I move on to that. Here is what I have working so far just using a 3-line cab

1	 I am using Arduino Leonardo and Ardumoto to drive 2 12v motors running at 1.3 amps each. I purchased a rechargeable battery of 12V with 5AH I first started by plugging in the battery to the Arduino via the barrel jack. Arduino then sparks and is fried. I read somewhere that I wasn\t supposed to hook it up to the Arduino and to hook it up to the VIN ports in the Ardumoto. I purchased a new Arduino and plugged in the Positive and negative from the battery to the ports and now the Ardumoto board fried copper lining on board burnt off. I\m reading online and from what I\ve gathered the Ardumoto can handle a max of 18 volts and a maximum of 2 amps per each output.

1	 Im looking for a way to allow Arduino to control a motor using PWM. So far what I have gathered is that using Arduinos PWM sets the digital value of 255 to 5v and 0 to 0v. However what I am looking to do is to set the motors to stop at 2.5v move forward as it approaches 5v and move backwards as it approaches 0v. Any suggestion on how I would go about accomplishing this will be highly appreciated.

1	 I want to control a low voltage hobby class motor with a 8Mhz/3.3v Arduino Pro Micro. Id like to power both from 2 alkaline cells. The motor draws approximately 1 A @ 3V with new batteries. I would be doing PWM of a couple of channels at the normal Arduino rates. My thought is to connect the batteries to the Vcc pin not Vraw and run the Arduino unregulated at about 3V but somewhat less when the motor is running. Im willing to reprogram the fuses for a lower brownout voltage or none if needed. Im feeling my way on the rest of this - Ill lay out my perhaps naive approach and get some feedback about whether Im understanding it and how to proceed. With such a low battery voltage a TIP120 darlington seems to drop too much voltage and substantially reduce the motor speed/power. So Im thinking that I need to use a power N channel MOSFET and it appears that I need to be fairly selective to get one which can sufficiently turn on with a &lt;3V gate to
1	 Using a H-bridge Ive connected my DC Motors to an Arduino. When I accept the external power source from a wall using a 9V battery eliminator the motors spin well and consistently. However when I connect it to a 9V battery the motors spin slower and the speed deteriorates till the motors stop. This happens in approximately 5 minutes. I checked with multiple 9V batteries of the same type. I have tested the batteries to check if theyre dead after the motors stop. They are not and if I reconnect the motors to them the same process occurs all over again. I have checked for short circuits and there are none. Any possible ideas as to why this is happening?

1	 Im learning the arduino platform and working on a circuit that connects the two pins of a piezo buzzer -- one to ground and the other to a digital pin of the arduino board. In this configuration is the arduinos digital pin acting as the positive terminal of the circuit? The arduino docs seem to suggest it is: They the digital pins can provide a substantial amount of current to other >circuits. Atmega pins can source provide positive current or sink provide >negative current up to 40 mA milliamps of current to other devices/circuits. Can the digital pins act as both positive and negative terminals in circuits? Does this question even make sense? What resources are out there that can help me better understand the underlying electronics of the arduino and microcontrollers in general?

1	 I want to use a servo motor and control it by an Arduino Duemilanove or a Leonardo. It seems to work fine when I connect it directly to Arduinos VCC GND and an PWM pin. But I am a bit worried if this is a good idea. The multimeter shows that it draws up to 0.6A which is about 10 times of what Id expect that the Arduino can provide. Is this correct or does this apply only to the digital out pins? Would it be better to power the servo using an external power supply? I thought it would be a nice and easy solution to power the Arduino using a USB power supply and to cut the USB cable and connect the servo directly to the +5V of the USB. But is there even a difference in powering the Arduino via USB and connecting the servo to the VCC of the Arduino? Is it a problem to connect GND and UGND? After first tests I think that the Arduino led is pulsating less using the hacked USB cable but still a pulsating LED shows that the servo is drawing a lot of power from the board.

1	 Im using the Registers of the Arduino micro to get a signal for Electronic Speed Controllers ESC for brushless motors.As far as I read ESCs interpret everything they can while just ignoring too fast update rates. If somebody knows better this would be a great time to yell. The goal is to get a digital signal where a timespan between 1 and 2 ms is HIGH and the rest low. Ideally I want this at 50-400Hz since 488Hz is the fastest possible frequency and 50 Hz the standard Servo frequency. I try to use Phase Correct Mode to count up and down continuously. As the value in the counter reaches my set OCRnx on the way up it sets the output pin LOW as it reaches the same value on the way down after reaching TOPvalue it sets the output HIGH. In ATmega documentation terms this is NON-inverted Phase-Correct-PWM. So I set the Registers DDR to set the pin as output TCCR1A and TCCR1B and ICR1 TOPvalue = between 20000 and 2500.

1	 I was doing some research about this subject and I only have more questions than answers. I want a little IMU sensor I dont know which hardware I should get that sends data wirelessly to my Arduino. The sender part IMU + sender + battery should be small tennis ball size is fine and the receiving part should be an Arduino. What should I buy? How can I achieve this? I was looking at a lot of ideas: Xbees bluetooth radio receivers Arduino Nano etc. My focus is on the Arduino code I just need that the IMU sends data at least at a ratio of 10ms. As a plus I would love to have more than one Wireless IMU sensor connected to my Arduino. 
1	 I want to plot the various signals sent to Arduino via Serial communication.What is the maximum frequency that can be showed without any signal distortion?

1	 Is it possible to directly communicate USB D+ D- to Arduino Mega serial port TX RX? 
1	 Can someone please tell me what\s going on with my LCD screen and how I can fix this issues below? I have the following: Arduino Uno R3 w/ ATMEGA 328P-PU 16x2 LCD TowerPro MicroServo SG90 DPDT Slide Switch w/ 120 ohm resistor Objective: Read the sensor value If switch is on or off and move a servo accordingly while displaying switch state on LCD. Issue: LCD display seems to receive random data during program run see image. All starts up well and as soon as a few seconds have lapsed in the void loop the screen becomes garbled. Also the switch value while debugging gets a zero reading while HIGH acting accordingly as if the switch was off. The servo motor runs as it should but gets random pulses every now and again where it starts to buzz but doesn\t turn. Images: Three images below. <img src
1	 Im trying to concurrently learn electronics and Arduino and have recently moved from simply powering LEDs to servos. In all my attempts with servos and reading about them especially multiple ones and when using external power supply plugged into the board experienced users often mention you use voltage regulators. Ive seen some Arduino schematics with servos and voltage regulators most that include some capacitors but I cant seem to find any tutorials or resources that explain why when and how to use these parts when learning electronics &amp; Arduino. Id like to go from there to transistors mosfets etc.

We have still completed the frame and now we think about controlling it in a electronic way. For example with a controller of a playstation or with our smartphones however it should be electronic so i think about to do this with an arduino board. We have two motors. One for the direction and the other one for the movement. The first has about 8 ampere and about 12 volt the other has 800 watt so around 40 ampere and 24 volt. My question is whether it is possible and if so how to control them or one them with an arduino board and what do i need in addition? It would be great if you could help us :

Depending on frequency rotate motor at calculated speed/power. We would also prefer to be able to do the following: Use absolute motor encoder to set motors to the same initial angle 0. Use back EMF to detect when motor meets heavy load. From what I\ve read online I think we need: Android phone Arduino board Wireless/Bluetooth USB dongle? Power supply Breadboard + AA batteries? 6 Motor driver 6 DC Motors absolute encoders Is this correct? Any recommendations/suggestions on what par
1	 Im building an analog switching circuit which is controlled by an arduino. My circuit requires 25 4066 quad-analog switches. To get the required analog voltage range for the switched inputs I need to provide +5v and -5v input power to all 25 of the 4066s. I have tried to use a 1044 charge pump to get -5v but it cant power more than one 4066 it seems. I only tried the std. 1044 circuit as provided in the data sheet. I also need to be able to provide switch control voltage of +5v and -5v to the 4066s to turn on and off the switches. I am not sure that the Arduino pins LOW output of 0v will be low enough to completely switch OFF the 4066 in the negative part of the analog signal. Could anyone help me by providing an idea for a circuit that do all that or maybe suggest a way forward? Thanks so much Bob 
1	 Is there any significant performance trade-off between buttons wired with the internal vs external pull-up/down resistors? I see a lot of tutorials demonstrating the use of external resistors when wiring a simple button like this and this . But since the Arduino/AVR includes internal pull-up resistors you can wire a button without any external resistor as demonstrated here . Is there any good reason to complicate your design with an extra resistor?

Now i disconnected all potentiometer &amp; giving 5v externally from source.When i give 5v to particular mux pin A0~A7 reads properly 5v and Zero when removed.Since i am switching pins every 50ms . Other pins reads 1v or 4v some time insted of 0v since they are not connected to any of the pins.you can see that A2 pin reading 5v. but other values are accumulated with improper value instead of Zero .

1	 I\m clueless when it comes to the information on datasheets for switches. When I see a datasheet for LEDs or servos I\m used to seeing a fairly straightforward call out for the required volts and amps. A project I\m working on now requires turning on an LED using a float switch like this one: Water Level Switch The max switching voltage and current values and minimum voltage info is really throwing me. The minimum voltage for instance is 250v DC! Does a $5 switch really require 250 volts? I haven\t been able to find many schematics where they are just using a switch like this without a pump or other hardware but I seem to remember seeing someone run a switch like this with 5v pin. And I\m totally unsure what the current would be/if I need a resistor etc.

1	 I have an Arduino Uno. I am building a custom shield and was wondering how I would connect two of the LEDs on the shield to the TX / RX LEDs on the Uno. Digital pins 0 and 1 seem obvious but after further research it appears that they are not for this. In better terms I want two LEDs on my shield that replicate the TX / Rx LEDs on the Arduino Uno. How would I do this? 
1	 I need to construct 4 reactors for an experiment requiring mixing. We want to automate the mixing and at the same time reduce cost. can we connect multiple stepper motors with 5 or 6 wires on one shield version 2? 
1	 I understand that when connecting an LED and a resistor in series; the resistor can be placed on any side of the LED as the current will remain same in a series connection. Please correct me if Im wrong but I was under the impression that conventionally the electrons flow from positive to negative. So shouldnt the resistor be placed before an LED to limit the flow of charge. In this scenario the negative is connected ground and the positive to a power source. So I dont understand the chain Link analogy as well. Where the whole chain moves as a whole because here the flow ends with the GND right ?

Somewhere else I read that the only difference between a 3.3V and 5V Pro Mini is the regulator. Are these assumptions correct? If yes can I use a 5V Pro Mini like a 3.3V by powering it with a 3V Battery on the 5V pin? 
1	 I have a Chinese rf module and I\m trying to communicate with arduino. Here\s the module. It\s 868MHz RS485 module and I connect one transceiver to arduino:RX->TX TX->RX VCC->5V GND->GND and the other one to PC with SU108-485 a USB bridge that come\s with the module. I can send text from my PC to my arduino using putty but when I try to send back using nothing happens. if Serial.available &gt; 0 { Serial1.printHello World;} if I connect this arduino to another arduino I can see it\s clearly transmitting if I connect the arduino straight to the SU108-485 USB bridge and skip the wireless module I can transmit from my PC but I get a strange output when I try to read the Hello world the arduino is sending. Does it matter the module is RS485 not RS232?

1	 I\m using an Arduino Uno with Funduino I2C 1602 LCD display. The LCD display is connected as LCD SCL--> A5SDA -->A4 I need to measure the temperature pressure and the velocity of a duct flow. So I connected a BMP180 to my arduino with the following connection SCL--> A5SDA -->A4 As you can see both of them are connected to same pins. The connection works fine just for BMP180 but when I add a rotary encoder and print its value on LCD I\m getting delayed and wrong data. I\m using this BMP180 library https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BMP085_Unified The LCD uses this library v1.2.0 https://bitbucket.org/fmalpartida/new-liquidcrystal/downloads how can I change bmp180 or LCD analog pins in these libraries? 
1	 Is it possible to use an Arduino connected to a 3 axis accelerometer to estimate a platform\s continuous change in position and orientation? I have a small mobile robot and given an initial position and velocity vector and sequence of acceleration changes I\d like to calculate the current position and velocity vector. From this question it sounds possible but I can\t find any reference to projects or code to accomplish it with an Arduino. I understand the main problem will be the build-up of errors over time but that\s ok as a rough estimate is acceptable. I\m also using wheel encoders to calculate the same values and I want to use the accelerometer to account for errors in the encoders like slippage. e.g. If the encoders say we\re accelerating at 1cm/sec but the accelerometer says we\re at a constant speed then I know to ignore the encoders because th

1	 I am trying to detect a change in the PVM signal using arduino uno. Basically a change in the controller changes the PWM signals duty cycle output from the receiver. The whole thing is an RC Car. I would like to detect the signals so that i can actuate the servo when it is steered right or left accordingly. But im not able to detect the change. Firstly i used digitalRead function and tried to calculate offtime and ontime delay but didnt observe any change even when the car is steered through the controller. Then i tried using analogRead function to calculate offtime and ontime delays. Again couldnt detect the change in signal. I tried to convert PWM signal to analog using low pass filter and input the analog signal to arduino. I couldnt detect a small change even here. I just print the state of the signal in serial manager and operate my controller and see if i could observe any change in the values. But its all the same. Is my method incorrect? W

I hooked each LED to its own pin directly A0-A4 for the countdown part 5 4 3 2 1 and then 5 additional LEDs to pin A5 GO!. For the countdown part when only one LED is on at a time there\s enought power. But If I were to light them all up at the same time there won\t be. So I figured that I should put a relay into the mix for that part and have them draw power from an external 12V power supply. I did managed to make the relay work in the circuit - switching all LEDs on/off and getting power from the external power supply. But only through one pin. I\m not sure how to have the start lights use an external power supply and at the same time get signals from multiple pins. How

1	 I want to use all six I/O pins of an ATtiny85 that means also using the reset pin as an I/O pin however I found out that if I disable the RESET pin I can no longer program the ATtiny using an ISP programmer. However I found out that there are bootloaders for ATtiny which as far as I understand allow me to program the ATtiny through USB without the need of the RESET pin. My question is : How do I burn such a bootloader such as micronucleus for example to the ATtiny85? And how do I need to connect the ATtiny to USB after that like this? ? How do I program it after that? Keep in mind that in terms of burning bootloaders and modifying fuses I am a complete newbie.

However it did not work it uploaded but I was at that point no longer able to communicate with the device. When I switched to Atmel Studio and used the ICE programmer my chip could not be read and recognized whereas before it could. I cant even program it.

1	 I have a very simple circuit: 5v -> LED 5mm forward voltage of 2 V and max. current of 20mA -> 1k ohm resistor -> GND. I want to know how much current is flowing in my circuit. I am using this formula: U = R x I Since U = 5 and R = 1000 the current is according to the formula: 5/1000 = 0.005A. So far so good. The problem is when I try to check the voltage drop over the resistor and the LED. For calculating the voltage drop in the resistor I would use the same formula where I is my current 0.005A and R is the resistor 1k ohm. The result is: 5 V. Something very weird is happening here cause the voltage drop around my resistor should not be 5 V cause I know there must be another voltage drop around the LED. If 5V is in the resistor it would mean that 0v is around the LED and it should not light up but it does. Thank you helping me with this basic calculus. 
1	 I have a source power with 2 V and 100mA. I have an LED that has a forward voltage of 2 V and a max current of 20mA. Should I use a resistor to reduce the current? I see many formulas in the internet saying the the resistor value should be: Source Voltage - LED forwared voltage/LED max current This formula always worked fine for me but now that I have a 2 V source power this formula tells me that the resistor should be 0 ohm. Of course this would damage my LED cause the 100mA provided by my source power is way above the 20mA current limit of the lED.

1	 So Im trying to read 4 different analog values and store each one to a variable. I imagine doing this by first initializing the ADC registers and each time it enters the ADC ISR checking which port it read from and saving it to the corresponding variable. Then setting the ADMUX to the next ADC port and repeating the whole process. Unfortunately something goes wonky and I just cant figure out what it is. If I get rid of the switch case and just read from one port it all works fine but if I put the switch case back in and try to cycle through them it stops working. Please ignore the rest of code as this is not complete. I just included everything I could. Eventually this will take in 4 values. Then use them for error checking and a PID loop.

1	 How do you determine if an Arduino shield uses 3.3V or 5V on their pins? Previously I thought all Arduino shields used 5V since thats what most Arduinos use. However Ive been researching Arduino-compatible single-board computers like the PCDuino and Galileo but these all seem to use 3.3V. More confusingly theyre vague about what types of Arduino shields they support. The PCDuino claims to only support 3.3V shields but has an adapter shield to convert 5V. The Galileo has a jumper to support either 3.3V or 5V shields. The main problem is how do you determine what voltage level Arduino shields use? I have a Seeedstudio motor shield and a Sain Smart sensor shield and while they both take 5V power input the docs dont mention anything about logic voltage level. How do I determine this? 
1	 Is it possible to use the 2760342 ultrasonic range sensor with an Arduino Due? The docs say it takes a 5V input but doesn\t specify the output but I\m assuming it also outputs a 5V signal. Does this make it incompatible with the Due? I\ve tested it with an Uno it it works flawlessly. I\ve been researching using a Due and some other ARM based single-board computers but they all seem to use 3.3V while almost all Arduino shields and sensors use 5V. I\m hesitant to upgrade to these boards if I have to purchase an entire new set of shields and sensors. And I have no interest in hacking in some clunky custom voltage level shifter. Why isn\t everything standardized on 5V? 
1	 I connect Arduino Yun to my Computer with wifi. I was able to get the IP address of my Arduino Yun. However when I try to print something. It seem to not working at all. The following code is the one that I try: void setup { Serial.begin9600; }void loop { // print labels Serial.printNO FORMAT; delay100;} I did not get any kind of error. However when I open the Serial Terminal it shows nothing at all. I try to use the same code with Arduino Uno. It works fine. 
1	 I am using an ArduinoFio and a BC127 datasheet . I\m having troubles getting the serial connection working properly from the Arduino to the BC127 and viceversa. I wasn\t able to communicate with the BC127 and I don\t know if is because isn\t correctly powered on or something else. I\ve connected pin 0 of the BC127 to GND pin 33 to 3V3 and pin 4142 RX TX to the TX RX arduino\s pins. I\ve tested with the tester that all wires are connected but the BC127 seems dead. Any help is appreciated :|

1	 I have a USB 2 Serial adapter and the device is working fine. I see the device perfectly configured in my System. I have connected the TX0 pin of Arduino to DB 2 pin read pin of the adapter. Below is my Arduino code: int i = 0;void setup{ Serial.begin9600;}void loop{ fori=0;i&lt;6;i++ { Serial.writeH; delay100; }} But when I try to read thru terminal software of data received at my COM port I see some junk character incoming. I am pretty sure that I am using same baud rate / flow setting both side. Why am I facing this issue - do I need to connect any other pins also as I just need to receive data at system side?

1	 I use official Arduino GSM Shield with Uno R3. I uploaded web server examples from official GSM library. I use a simple python script to make TCP/IP connections to my GSM Shield web server. I send simple requests from my computer to shield and it responses back. At first this worked like a charm. I even connected a led to arduino uno and started turn it on and off. But after some time I get timeout errors from my script. I turned on debug mode of gsm shield. At first it displayed normal stuff. When connection gone between my computer and shield it doesnt showed anything on serial window. I thought there is something wrong with shield but when I send a request from my computer; light of the shield indicates that there is a transmission incoming; but nothing shows on serial window. I think after some time connection between arduino and gsm shield gets broken. What could be done to make this web server more stable? I dont want it stop working af

1	 Im having trouble getting the atmega328p chip to upload sketches using my ftdi. It always comes up with an error saying not in sync. I have an 8Mhz crystal with 22pf capacitors. The weird thing is I could flash the bootloader using my avrispmkII @ 3.3v. AFAIK this tells me the chip is running. I have an led connected to pin7. It doesnt flash when turn the power on. However it does flash when powered from 5v and everything is working fine. I could upload sketches using the ftdi. I have the ftdi on a breakout to pin headers. I have the reset pin wired up to the DTR via a 100nf capacitor. The reset has a 10k pull up. CTS pin is grounded. The usart is as follows tx atmega ---> rxftdi and rxatmega to txftdi. I have also switch between 3.3v and 5v logic using the vccio pin on the ftdi. I.e. vccio = 5v if atmega is 5v. I know the programmer need to know what voltage am using how critical is it since I dont have a 3.3v regulator to hand. I used a lm338 and
1	 I\m working with Arduino Uno Adafruit PN532 NFC/RFID Shield and along with other modules. I\m posting this test program because I found there\s conflict with the serial output while writing code to integrate all the modules together. I tried troubleshooting by running this code. The result wasn\t what I\d expected. In Arduino as far as I know setup only runs once after starting the program and then loop will be executed repeatedly. I ran the example sketch called readMiFare provided by Adafruit alone and it was fine. This code can be found at https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NFCShield_I2C/blob/master/examples/readMifare/readMifare.pde .

1	 I am working on a simple project using an Arduino Mega 2560 that involves reading a 12-bit binary encoder signal and which is used to cycle a digital pin high and low depending on the angular location of the encoder. My problem is that when the digital output pin is told to go low it only goes down to about 4V. I also noticed that it would occasionally dip down to ground instead of just 4V. Much to my surprise when I unplug the Arduino the digital output pin is still reading 4V. When I turned off power to my encoder which is connected up the the Arduino through 12 digital input pins the output pin dropped down to 0V. When I turn the encoder back on it goes back up to about 4V. I have tried connecting the output pin to ground and obviously the voltage goes to 0 but as soon as I remove the connection to ground the voltage springs back up to around 4V. It appears as though somehow the voltage being fed to the digital input pins in the form of a ~5V digital input si
1	 So I am not new to arduino however I am new with web servers. I am working on a project that can control a robotic arm that is at one location and I can be at my house. I know basic HTML Basic CSS Basic JavaScript and a tiny bit of JQuery. Only reason I say basic is because I self taught all these languages to myself using codeacademy. So I have a few questions since I done research on the matter. Can a project like this be done with just the languages I know? All the tutorials I have looked at say you have to know AJAX and JSON. I have no idea what these are. Also for the interface I need to be able to take the value of the encoders on the robot and view them. I also need a button that will record the value at that point in time of the encoders so I can configure the points and maybe even name them. A box where I can see the points and their coordinates and finally a box where i can place points in and then execute a sequence. How tough should this be?</p

1	 I encountered a problem while working with Adafruit Bluefruit BLE and Adafruit PN532 NFC/RFID shield. Normally the bluetooth module starts advertising as soon as BLESerial.begin is called. In my case it didn\t start advertising even if BLESerial.begin was called in the setup. Source code: https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=959C60D417DEA366!136&amp;authkey=!AA33qSOnQbT2vhY&amp;ithint=folder%2c As you can see in the serial output console Bluefruit only started advertising after scanning a card on the NFC/RFID reader. However what I would like to see is to advertise Bluefruit as soon as the board is set up. For the record both the modules are in good shape as I tested them by running example sketches provided by Adafruit
0	 Is it possible to upgrade the firmware on an Arduino so that it can do more things such as change undervolting/ overvolting in order to provide more processing power. To do this you would have to most likely re flash the chip itself so how would that be accomplished?

0	 I\ve made a clock using an Arduino but the time seems to drift. I am aware of the rollover issue; the clock seems to drift by about 15 minutes over the course of a week. I\m using a custom PCB with this resonator from Digi-key. The code reads the millis function at the beginning of each loop and works from that value. My question is: How can I measure time with an Arduino accurately enough to make a passable desk clock? 
0	 I have been able to connect MATLAB to my Uno with this line of code: a = arduino\COM4\; through this package: Matlab support package for Arduino . Right now MATLAB is my main script that will synchronize all the components [like the Arduino]. I am able to send pulses to my stepper-motor just by using: void loop { digitalWrite2 HIGH; delay1; digitalWrite2 LOW; delay1;} This works fine and will make the motor move about once every 2 milliseconds. My problem is that I cannot find a way to produce this same delay through MATLAB\s interface. I do know that MATLAB has a pause function but when I set up a loop in MATLAB like this: a = arduino\COM4\;for m = 1:400 a.digitalWrite2 1; pause0.001; a.digitalWrite2 0; pause
0	 If you want to submit sensor data such as temperature to a remote server/database somewhere you need to use some kind of call to a web server since it isnt possible to connect directly to a database from the Arduino.

0	 I would like my compiles to exclude some code depending upon the flash/program space available. To be used in the demo code of a library I support. Whereas my current solution is to use a #ifdef of processor type. But I would like to be more general and not have to specify all the various chips. Rather it would be nice if there was a pre-processor constant that stated the available size. Where I am not fluent enough in gcc and or avr-gcc I might expect to find some constants similar those that define the beginning and end of the heap. On case example. Is that both the UNO and Leo have 32K of Flash. But the Leos core library uses 4K for USB support resulting in only 28K available. My Librarys demo is near maxed out on the UNO and I would like to automatically trim out based on available program space.

0	 Question: What registers do I use to access the IO on the Arduino Uno when I am using assembly for programming? Background: I was interested in practicing my assembly language skills on the Arduino I thought it would be easier to turn LEDs on/off than to worry about console IO. From doing a preliminary search I have found that the AVR toolchain can be used to program the Arduino. Yet I don\t quite know how to find the corresponding registers for the IO pins.

On the seeeduino website it says that It is based on the Duemilanove schematic 100% compatible to its existing program shield and IDEs. In fact I never had any problems with shields or the IDE. My question is now: Is the seeeduino and other clones really 100% compatible? The seeeduino board was considerable cheaper then an arduino.

0	 The function millis would be running in the span of 100+ microseconds or less. Is there a reliable way to go about measuring the time taken by a single millis call? One approach that comes to mind is using micros however a call to micros will include the time taken by the function call of micros itself as well so depending on how long micros takes the measurement for millis may be off. I need to find this as an application I am working on requires accurate time measurements for every step taken in the code including millis .

My question is: How would I go about porting a library like this? What are the steps key files etc? One obvious issue is that PSOC Creator does not readily support C++. One positive might be that the Arduino Due board is based on the Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU. NOTE: If you think this question is off topic; please head over to this question on Arduino Meta to voice your opinion on whether questions on Arduino Compatible devices are appropriate for this list. 
0	 Question: How does one prepare clothing with embedded electronics for washing? Background: There are several Arduino boards/clones that are designed for wearable tech. For example the Lilypad . Wearable tech with LED light patterns microphones GPS or other circuitry is an interesting concept but water and electricity tend not to mix. To prepare wearable tech for washing I would assume people make large circuitry removable. Yet inevitably some electronics will be more-or-less permanently affixed to the cloth. What if anything can be done to these electronics e.g. sewn-in Arduino Lilypad to make them washing-machine preferred--hand wash could be done but it\s so much easier to machine wash safe?

0	 Question: Where do I put code if I want it to execute only once per Arduino startup? Background: I tend to use my Arduino to perform tasks that should be executed once per power cycle. For example my robot should only drive forward once every time I turn it on--more than that and it might fall off the table. The standard Arduino IDE template consists of a loop and a setup function. The setup code is run once per power cycle and the loop is re-started every time it finishes. I see two approaches to code 1 time tasks: Method 1: Loop once void setup { //do setup stuff}void loop { //do task while1 ; //Repeat forever preventing function from re-starting} Method 2: Setup only void setup { //do setup stuff //do task}void loop { //do nothing} More detailed form of quest

Please keep in mind that I will essentially be having to send the data for 4 motors compressor different temperatures random things and the 3 sections of the arm. 
0	 Sometime in the past I was burning bootloaders on a fresh batch of four ATmega328-PU using the Arduino IDE notice theres no P after 328 - its the slightly cheaper non-picopower version of the MCU not to be confused with the ATmega328P-PU with a P and was surprised with the following message from avrdude: avrdude: Device signature = 0x1e950F avrdude: Expected signature for ATMEGA328 is 1E 95 14 Double check chip or use -F to override this check. That means avrdude thought the chip was not what its label said. Then I changed the chip type on my Arduino IDE to ATmega328P-PU and avrdude burned the bootloader without complaints. What that means is that the chip was labelled as one MCU and internally it responded as another slightly different. What I would like to know is: How rare is this event? Has anyone had a similar experience? Or
0	 According to the Arduino documentation the ATmega328 has 32KB of Flash memory for the bootloader + uploaded sketch and only 2KB SRAM for runtime data. The ATmega2560 has quite a bit more totalling 256KB and 8KB respectively. In either case those limits seem rather small especially when compared to similarly sized consumer devices such as smartphones. What can you do if you run out? E.g. if your sketch is too big or you need to process a lot of data such as strings at runtime? Is there any way to expand the Flash or SRAM?

0	 I\m currently trying to create an Arduino time clock by using the PJRC Time library http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Time.html . I know that since most of the Arduino boards are running with a 16MHz clock and a single resonator the time can become out-of-sync after a certain period of time. However I was wondering if anyone has an idea about the accuracy of the Time library when used on the Arduino DUE with a 84MHz clock. I\ve been testing it out and so far the clock has been kept in sync for a few hours. Thanks! 
0	 I am working on a mobile robot controlled via a wireless 2.4 GHz link.The receiver is connected to the Arduino Uno which serves onboard as the main controller. The most critical and main input channel coming from the receiver produces a very noisy signal which leads to lots of minor changes in the output of the actuators even though these are not needed.

0	 I am used to relays some and they are useful especially for large loads like a incandescent light bulb or other 120V AC device. However it seems like overkill to use a relay for a bunch of LEDs linked together parallel that use 60 mA too much for the Arduino. Also it wouldnt work if you wanted to turn it on/off frequently or do PWM. Ive heard some about transistors and MOSFETS and know a little about them. When should I use each one and how do I know what type to get? Also it seems like relays can be more expensive than transistors/MOSFETS. Edit: How can I use these with my Arduino?

0	 Once you have uploaded a sketch to one of your Arduino boards it is hard to know exactly what source code led to that sketch. Indeed you may change the source code of your sketch on your PC without updating it in binary format to your board. I had the idea of setting up a kind of sketch repository that would be populated as soon as I upload a sketch to one of my boards. Then I could retrieve later on the source code for a sketch running on any of my boards. For such a repository I would first need to have an index that would enable me to know which board the sketch source code is linked to. Typically such an index should be unique for every single arduino board. Hence my question: how can I get a unique ID for an Arduino board? Edit: This is my current list of boards the miniumum list to be supported by a single unique ID approach: UNO R3 Mega 2560 Y

Bonus points for the audacious: How would you go about creating an error checking mechanism and then increasing the baud rate ridiculous high to get high transfer rates? 
0	 Currently my sketch is checking an input pin every time round the main loop. If it detects a change it calls a custom function to respond to it. Heres the code trimmed down to the essentials: int pinValue = LOW;void pinChanged{ //...}void setup{ pinMode2 INPUT;}void loop{ // Read current input int newValue = digitalRead2; // Has the input changed? if newValue != pinValue { pinValue = newValue; pinChanged; }} Unfortunately this doesnt always work properly for very short changes on the input e.g. brief pulses especially if loop is running a bit slowly. Is there a way to make the Arduino detect the input change and call my function automatically? 
0	 Ive been using the pulseIn function for processing PWM-based binary data encoding. It works well for distinguishing pulses which are significantly different lengths e.g. 500us vs. 1500us. That makes it more than sufficient for handling typical IR remotes. However I want to make my own IR system which can use more than 2 pulse lengths so that data transfer can occur faster. Ideally Id like to use 8 different pulse lengths for octal encoding e.g. 200us 400us 600us etc.. Ive noticed quite significant variations in the values returned by pulseIn though +/- 10%. I expect at least some of it is introduced by the IR transmitter and receiver modules but I dont have good enough equipment to verify that. Assuming I can mitigate that external error is pulseIn likely to be precise enough to distinguish such similar pulses?

0	 A commonly used library is the DallasTemperature library used to access DS18B20 sensors on a 1-Wire bus. When creating a DallasTemperature object you pass a reference to a OneWire object. OneWire can create a 1-Wire bus on pretty much any port of an Arduino. An example of this is like so: // Setup a oneWire instance to communicate with any OneWire devices not just Maxim/Dallas temperature ICsOneWire oneWireONE_WIRE_BUS;// Pass our oneWire reference to Dallas Temperature.DallasTemperature sensors&amp;oneWire; However there are some issues with using OneWire to drive a 1-Wire bus mainly around driving longer bus lengths dealing with shorts and other errors. There is a commonly available chip called the DS2482-100 that can drive longer busses hundreds of feet deals with

In my research Ive often seen stepper driver boards advertised ranging from very big and expensive through to quite small and cheap.

0	 I have following setup: Arduino Duemilanove Small water heater connected with optical relay PWM is ok Waterproof DS18B20 temperature sensor Unknown amount of water but temperature sensor and heater are always underwater. How can I accurately control water temperature based on temperature sensor readings? By accurately I mean up to accuracy of temperature sensor in this case 0.5C. Everything should run on Arduino so no additional data storage or processing power is available. For debugging I can obviously use computer. I have tried running PID but it seems really hard to Avoid overshooting - going over target temperature either initially or when cold water is added Stabilize properly after adding cold water. 
0	 When youre writing a typical sketch you usually rely on loop being called repeatedly for as long as the Arduino is running. Moving in and out of the loop function must introduce a small overhead though. To avoid that you could presumably create your own infinite loop like this: void loop{ while true { // do stuff... }} Is that a viable way to improve performance? Will it cause other problems if loop never returns?

However I have understood that Arduino 64GB SD FAT and large amount of data are not working too well. Does Arduino work well with this amount of data on FAT? Theres no need to read any data from SD on Arduino. If not is there a better approach? Writing directly to SD without FAT? This data logger will be on the environment where no computer or network connection is available. Performance is not an issue - around 8kB/s over three months is already enough.

0	 I have a clone of a Mega 2560 and the Chinese manufacture apparently had a broken shift key. To my annoyance whenever I connect it to my computer it reads arduino compatible mega 2560 . With my extreme annoyance with slightly misspelled or incorrectly capitalised English it has been very distracting to me. However the reason that Im asking this question is for more than how to rename it to be capitalised. Think of how many projects could be simplified by this! Or for many Arduinos you can label they physically and then rename them Arduino #1 etc. so you can tell which port it is on using device manager. If you designed a product with Arduino then you can even rename it to your product name. I would imagine that there would be an easy way to do this by reburning the firmware to the [Insert USB chip model #### here].

0	 I\d like to be able to use Python from a sketch. According to the Arduino playground one can use PySerial from a computer to talk with an Arduino via Python. It looks like from that page you can also use various API\s to use Python with an Arduino from a computer. However I\d like to know if you can execute Python directly from a sketch. It would be nice because then you could execute Python directly from a sketch and not all of it would have to be written in Python. If this is not possible is there an easy way to execute Python on an Arduino? Looking at the various API\s it was hard to determine exactly what they did and if you could execute a .py script from a computer or from anything on the Arduino.

My current idea is to have an arduino collecting data from the pressure transducer while being connected to the winch adjusting it up/down as needed based on the desired inputted depth. The arduino would then be connected to the a Raspberry Pi B via USB. The Raspberry Pi would then communicate via wifi USB adapter to a router @ 2.5 GHz 802.11n on the shore which would then communicate with the laptop on the shore. The important thing is that the laptop on the shore will be recording data as well as changing the input depth for the arduino. Arduino &lt;==> Raspberry Pi &lt;==> Router

0	 Arduino is an odd hybrid where some C++ functionality is used in the embedded worldtraditionally a C environment. Indeed a lot of Arduino code is very C like though. C has traditionally used #define s for constants. There are a number of reasons for this: You can\t set array sizes using const int . You can\t use const int as case statement labels though this does work in some compilers You can\t initialize a const with another const . You can check this question on StackOverflow for more reasoning. So what should we use for Arduino? I tend towards #define but I see some code using const and some using a blend. 
0	 When reading/trying a recent answer I was surprised to see that Arduino\s String class supports the c_str method just like the C++ std::string class. As expected it appears to get a pointer to the string\s contents as a null-terminated char array i.e. C-style string. However as far as I can see that method is not mentioned in the official Arduino documentation. Additionally in all example code I\ve seen using String a different approach seems to be used. A secondary char buffer is setup and then the contents of the string are copied to it using String::toCharArray . This obviously requires double the memory plus an On copy operation. It seems like c_str should be the preferred approach. Is there some reason why t

0	 Stepper motors are often pricey for a large motor. However with a powerful standard DC motor and a rotary encoder you can simulate a stepper motor. How accurate are rotary encoders with Arduino just with a basic loop and not much other code? Is it going to miss a pulse and not record enough rotation often? How can I handle this with much more code? Is there a better way to do this? Would interrupts help? Is there some sort of circuit that would help with this problem? Note: It will probably not exceed 4 rotations a second... That may be a lot but if you\re doing a lead screw type mechanism that would only be 24 inches a minute if there is 10 rotations per inch of linear motion.

However whenever I observe the serial port be that through the Arduino serial monitor or in attempting to plot the values of time using millis against ECG voltage the values reset so millis resets the zero which is fine except that some of the older values still show up.

0	 Im playing around with a SparkFun Redboard essentially an Arduino UNO. I have a simple 5V sensor that Id been trying to get to work with A2 and analogRead. Nothing seemed to work. Its supposed to be cycling from 0 to 5V which should give me values from 0 to 1023 and instead I get constant values of around 260. In desperation I tried using other ports. On A0 A1 and A3 I get the signals I expect. On A2 still nada. So the question. Is there something I could have done in configuring things that would have made A2 and only A2 stop reading correctly? If so how can I reset it? Or is there some other function that I might be using that could interfere with A2? Currently Im only using Serial over USB - could that interfere with A2? Or could I simply have fried the port?

0	 I have sourced an LPG consumption meter from China with pulse output. I am looking to hook the output up to an arduino to get the consumption metrics. Unfortunately there is not too much documentation available on the unit that I can find. The suppliers inform me that: Black wiresignal 1 Black wiresignal 2 Red wireearth wire So that\s a start I know the unit pulses a signal for every cubic meter of gas consumed. What I\m wanting to know is: What are the input [likely] voltages for the unit or how could I establish this? How do I wire the unit to an arduino? I can cook up a sketch to do the reading but what is the signal I am looking for? The mechanical meter itself has a metallic strip on the 0 digit of the wheel how it achieves the pulsing itself no doubt so another approach would be something like this http://phk.freebsd.dk/Gasdims/ w
0	 C on embedded systems has traditionally use structs to hold structured data. Arduino brings C++ to the table so we can use classes instead. Lets say we have two different data structures which could be considered very similar: typedef struct { int valueOne; int valueTwo; int valueThree;} value_t; and: class Value{ public: int valueOne; int valueTwo; int valueThree;} In terms of memory what difference will this make? I still see the struct technique being used heavily - why is this? 
0	 I\m new to Arduino and consequently to circuits. I\ve been reading Arduino Robotics by Warren and this was a circuit present in the book. From what Warren has said electricity in the circuit travels from the negative pole to the positive BUT to imagine it as going the other way for simplicity. So looking at this circuit... it seems useless to have the resistor placed after the LED based on the + --> - model. Wouldn\t the LED turn on before going through the resistor rendering the resistor useless? Sorry if this seems like a basic concept I\m entirely new to this.

0	 I have been using the Arduino to record some data. In my Arduino sketch I also used the millis function so I can keep track of the time at which each value I am measuring is taken. However I noticed that the timing isnt correct. For example 30 seconds in real life only comes out as 10 seconds made up example. Am I correct in saying that the Arduino delay function affects the time keeping using millis ? In other words suppose I have a delay of 50ms does that mean the millis function stops for that duration as well and then continues and so on for the duration of the connection? I noticed this when I tried plotting some data and finding that the frequency of the peaks in my data was too frequent given the time which had passed by. So I want to know if that is the reasoning for this mismatch of timing and if so how do I fix this so that I can keep the time each sample occurs? To give some context here is my sketch: <pre

0	 I am trying to build a device that will allow me to control at least a couple hundred raising platforms. The goal of this is to create a real time editor for board games Dungeons and Dragons . Ideally: All the platforms would move simultaneously The platforms would be transparent to allow us to place LEDs inside them to color the platform so we can make colors like blue for water and brown for dirt. In our current setup we use some acrylic prisms that are 1 inch x 1 inch x 6 inch width length height. We wanted to use a CNC motor like system to move something around and move a platform. Obviously this can only raise/lower one item at a time. We calculated on paper quite a long update time calculated approximately 1 sec per platform to raise/lower a platform. A CNC linear drive type system is the only solution we found that had a reasonable cost/quality a CNC motor for every platform also raised the power consumption very high

0	 I have a custom Arduino ATMega328 board that generally runs at 5V @ 8MHz using the Arduino Pro 3.3V 8MHz profile and bootloader. The main reason Im using this setup is so that I can put the board to sleep when main power is disconnected and it starts being run off of battery power 3V from a coin cell. The 5V and 3V sources are diode ORed together and the 5V input is tied to INT0. In code when it detects that INT0 has fallen low it initializes sleep mode and everything powers down with the exception of the watchdog timer that keeps a 1Hz cycle to keep an internal count and check it the chip should be woken back up. This works beautifully when 5V power is applied first then the battery is inserted then 5V is disconnected. It goes to sleep and when 5V is brought back it wakes up and I can see it hasnt lost count. However the problem comes when 3V is applied first . Im honestly not sure if its even booting. But what it is supposed to do is b

0	 My hardware is 4 potentiometers connected to Arduino Analog 0-3 the output is an RGB led driver connected to Digital outputs 91011. The output channels provide access to PWM control of those pins. So idea is the color and intensity can be controlled by the Arduino. I wrote a simple Sketch that reads the potentiometers and then outputs PWM to the RGB driver circuitry. This works great! So the hardware is working! Now comes the last potentiometer... I want to make the last potentiometer a mode select control. It would function like this: If the last potentiometer Pot4 is turned down all the way then all lights are off. If the level is turned up a little the Arduino then controls the RGB channels via Pots 1 2 &amp; 3. If Pot4 is turned up to just past halfway the sketch enters a strobe flash pattern pulsing all channels on and off. And if the mode control Pot4 is turned up all the way Arduino turns on all RGB channels. How do I implement? Mode selection via a

These are likely bugs that need following up with one or both of the parties but in the meantime I would like my code to compile with both of them without editing.

Are there any macros or similar that are readily available as in require no modification of the toolchain or IDE that would allow me to detect which is in use?

0	 new to arduino I\m struggling with what sounds like fairly n00b problem...I\ve wired up a adafruit GPS-board to my Arduino and it is working as it spits out GPS data to the serial port with Serial.printGPS.latitude DEC I Now want to concat a string which I can process read: I want to sent it via an ethernet client.This is what I got already: ......String vnnt = $VNNT;if GPS.fix { vnnt += GPS; //this works: vnnt.concatGPS.fix; //but this not: vnnt.concatGPS.latitude;}else{ vnnt += INFOAcquiring Sats;}Serial.printlnvnnt; The error message is: Call of overloaded \concatfloat&amp;\ is ambiguous When I Serial.printGPS.latitude DEC it results in: 4418.5937996050 So it is probably to big or something... How can I concat the vars and create the long string? 
0	 Ive been looking for a while inside Arduinos files to find the core library. However I havent found them yet. Where on my hard drive can I obtain the core library files .cpp and .h necessary for all Arduino code? Looking around on Google I couldnt find a way to find the above files. I did see something about getting an .a file while Arduino is compiling however that isnt what I want. I want to browse the code and look at functions such as delay to see how they would react when given the values not expected. i.e. Will my code stall if I use delay-200; by not being to exit the loop or will it create a black hole and disrupt the space-time continuum? 
0	 I am using the arduinconnector ANE to connect to an arduino baord in an AIR application. https://code.google.com/p/as3-arduino-connector/ Can anyone tell me if its possible to connect to more than 1 board simply by instantiating additional instances of the ANE and passing in unique port #\s? Or is there some reason why this isn\t possible and a unique AIR application is required for every arduino you connect to? 
0	 I have an Arduino Mega 2560 and it was working fine until about lunch time when I started getting this error: avrdude: stk500v2_ReceiveMessage: timeoutavrdude: stk500v2_getsync: timeout communicating with programmer I know it isn\t the code I\m running as I tried to load it onto an UNO and it seemed to load without issue. I need to use the Mega as it has more ports though. From what I have read this is potentially an issue with the bootloader and is possibly related to the current version of Arduino. I know virtually nothing about the bootloader; all I know is that it is used to upload code to the Arduino I think... therefore I have a fear of just messing around with related files unknowingly. These pages are the ones I\ve been looking at but like I said I don\t really know enough to feel comfortable with just messing around with the files. http://forum
0	 When messing around with code and uploading a sketch to my Arduino board I almost accidentally pulled out the USB cord. Everything is fine but then I started thinking what wouldve happened if I had pulled it out. How safe is avrdude? Could it damage or brick the board? Id imagine that you would just have to upload code to it again... but what would happen before you upload the new code? Ive seen something about how you can always upload new code if the bootloader is intact but I would imagine that there would be some problems. If this were to happen should I unplug everything connected in case Arduino writes a HIGH to an input or similar that would damage the component? 
0	 Ive been browsing Aliexpress and eBay for decent Arduino enclusures but Ive found out they are even pricier then boards themselves. Then Ive realized that there are multiple firms that offer cheap laser cutting - I can buy 1 sq.m acrylic sheet and order cutting multiple parts of boxes at once. Obviously I am not the first one who came up with this idea. Has anyone seen downloadable vector layouts I can use as something to start from? Thanks. 
0	 The Arduino boards provide an analog input range of 0V to 5V which translates to 0 to 1023 integer values. The range is determined by the on-board ADC which in the case of the Uno is a 10 bit ADC 2^10 = 1024. Do any of the official boards have a larger >10 bits ADC? Do any boards provide a wider range of analog input values?

0	 I am a novice user of Arduino. I am not sure whether I can connect both USB and external supply through power adaptor to Arduino simultaneously. Would this burn the controller? Basically I want to automatically shutdown the computer after saving all open documents before my UPS battery goes out whenever I am not there to manually shut it down. I am trying to notify the computer about the power failures of main supply - AC 220V 50 Hz notification/signal sent when power goes out via USB using Arduino. I am thinking that this can be done by using the external voltage power supply pin. Whenever power goes out in the mains the external voltage power supply pin will drop to 0 V from 7 V. The value of the voltage can be read using software I am unclear about this: Can it be done? If yes how?. The arduino will still be powered up as it is connected to USB of computer and thereby communicate to the computer about the power failure.

0	 I have made a simple program using the int main {} function. It has a delay in it. It is evident the code before the delay is running but the delay never seems to time out and let the next instructions through. Is this by design? If I rename the method and call it exactly once from the loop {} function though it does work. Edit: The code borrowed the main function and I suppose redefined it: int main { Forward; delay3000; Reverse;}void Forward { //...}void Reverse { //... } I can see this redefinition of main could cause some serious issues based on the answer below.

0	 I recently noticed how the map function in Arduino was bulky in both terms of flash space used and time taken to execute largely because it deals with long and involves a division and multiplication. Many times you can replace maps with more basic functions i.e. output = mapinput010230255; can become output = input &gt;&gt; 2; or output = mapinput0102310230; can become output = 1023 - input; I have one line in some code that says: backlight = mapLDRreading0102350250; How could this be simplified so that it is both space and time efficient? Ill allow slight differences in output values if it results in a much better solution. 
0	 I have done quite a few projects with Arduino but have never done more than a Hello World in C. I am writing my first library and a lot of the object oriented stuff is going over my head. Anyway my library is working as it is supposed to I pass a float to my function and it formats it properly and sends it out over serial. However I implemented it in a clunky way. The Arduino API Style Guide mentions a way that seems much better: When using serial communication allow the user to specify any Stream object rather than hard-coding Serial. This will make your library compatible all serial ports on Mega and the Due and can also use alternate interfaces like SoftwareSerial. The Stream object can be passed to your library\s constructor or to a begin function as a reference not a pointer. See Firmata 2.3 or XBee 0.4 for examples of each approach. Can anybody elab

0	 I have a project that I\m currently working on. We have built a green wall wich consists of plants on a wall Now we have a pump situated at the bottom that waters all the plants. There is an arduino board that decides when to put the pump on. Powering it is a solar panel and wind turbine. We want to know how much energy we have saved by using the solar panel and turbine. Question: How do I measure the amount of energy in Wh used from 00h00 that day? Is there a library? Or is this not possible with Arduino? Thanks a lot. To clear up some things No the pump is not fueled directly by the Arduino pin. We are using a motor shield. Yes there is an accumulator in the circuit. The solar and wind power recharge a battery which in turn powers the components. I would like to know the entire energy consumed not just the pump.

0	 I am sending three analog signals through the xbees to be written to analog pins on the receiving side so they can be read in Simulink. I connected both of the arduino megas to my laptop and uploaded the sketches. I have a shield and a series one xbee connected to each arduino. I pulled up the serial monitor for each sketch. I connected a 1 volt DC power supply to all three analog pins. On the transmitting serial monitor I got numbers close to 200 which I believe is correct but on the receiving side I was not getting anything. I believe the problem is with the arduino. After I uploaded the code on the transmitting side the TX led was green but the RX led on the receiving side was not lit up at all. The power LED on the transmitting arduino is red but it is green on the receiving side. The L led on the transmitting side is red on the transmitting side is read and yellow on the receiving side. On both of the xbee shield the power leds are red and the DIO5 led blinks green. On the r

0	 The Arduino Uno has an ICSP header that I imagine is for programming the board using a separate ICSP programmer. That is its ICSP header turn the board into a target. Can one use that same ICSP to program other boards turning the Arduino Uno effectively into a ICSP AVR programmer? How? I\m assuming that the target boards would also be Arduinos and wanted the Uno to program them using the Arduino IDE. Is that possible? Reading the AVR In-System Programming Application Note it looks to me that the only issue would be to make the programmer the Arduino Uno control the target board reset line. I\ve seen something like that in ArduinoISP sketch but in that sketch the target reset is controlled by port D10. But one could program the reset line to be an output right? So could we change the ArduinoISP sketch to use its own reset line as output to control the target board reset line?

0	 I am new to Arduino however I have experience in web development lately I have been using meteor js and the mean stack for different projects. However I am open to trying any language for development. What I am trying to do is build a simple application to control the LED on the Arduino over the web. I am working with another person and the Arduino will be behind a firewall so I am not sure how to access it via the internet. I do have access to an Arduino Uun that I can use for testing at home which does have linio connected via bridge which I don\t quite understand what that does. I\ve also heard of this but would like to stay away from third party builds as much as possible if I can do it myself. Whats the common way to do this with an Arduino behind a firewall? How do I do this with a Arduino Yun? Is it easier with a Yun? 
0	 This article describes a method to extend the battery life: use a low-power controller to switch on the Arduino only when needed. The author states that this method uses considerably less power than using Arduino\s sleep mode. Are there downsides to this approach? Which variant should I build? The TPS61240 variant seems to use something from Circuits@Home that\s not available anymore. I\d appreciate schematics or links to detailed instructions. Background: I\m building a sensor device that\s in an environment with no mains power supply. The sensor should wake up eg. hourly read eg. a temperature sensor possibly send an SMS and then go back to sleep. 
0	 How would I measure resistance over a certain length? In this case the resistance is variable. What I have in my head is that you would output a certain amount of current from one pin and measure how much comes back from the other. I\m not sure if this would work or how to implement it in code. I\ve seen this forum post but it\s not making much sense to me. How can I measure resistance? 
0	 My high school is entering an ROV competition and for next year\s competition we want to try and set it up so that we can control it using a PS4 controller. I have done research and found this shield for Arduino and this library that allows you to connect it to an Arduino. I plan to then connect the Arduino to a computer via USB and then send each button press to a Processing program via serial. Would it then be possible to send this from Processing to another Arduino out of the laptop? I\m just wondering how feasible this project is. We initially had just a single Arduino at the top with the Ethernet shield and took inputs from standard joystick potentiometers. We want to add in using the PS4 controller this year for easier control. We found the USB Host Shield that gives us

0	 I\m working with an Adafruit LSM303DLHC Accelerometer Sensor hooked up to an Arduino. I\ve downloaded the appropriate libraries to make it work and uploaded the example sketch accelsensor.pde. I then placed my sensor at rest on a flat surface and obtained the following acceleration vector values on average in units of meters per second: X: -0.24 Y: -0.71 Z: 10.47 At rest each of these three values fluctuate approximately +-0.04 on average. As I see it the values are off a bit. At rest the X and Y components should hover closer to 0m/s^2 while the Z component should be closer to 9.8m/s^2. What is the best way to compensate for this biased measurement? Should I simply add back the average observed bias? Or is there a more robust method to calibrate the sensor values? 
0	 I was playing with getting my servos to be on dedicated power separate form the Arduino entirely but obviously controlled by the Arduino. I originally had the ground of the Arduino joined with the - of the battery but to my surprise my Arduino continued to control the servos when I remove the ground wire entirely from the Arduino. I was under the impression that all electricity must form a complete circuit and be a closed loop. But my Arduino can obviously send a signal to a component that has no return path to itself. I feel like I\m missing something fundamental about a electricity. So my question is: Why does this work?

0	 I recently started messing around with an Arduino and I have made a few gadgets using shields. I then wondered how I would go about using things I can\t find shields for. One specific thing I want to do is to be able to use the larger e-paper displays from Pervasive Displays 7\\ and 10\\ but a brief consultation with Google found no Arduino kits or shields. I then looked through the documentation of the timing controller for the 7\\ display and found the information required to be able to use it initiation sending data to be drawn opcodes etc.. I then decided to check the Github repo for the examples for the 2\\ displays and they seem to just do what the documentation says to do. Is my observation naive here? Is it really as straightforward as following the documentation? No magic sauce? Note: I don\t have a clue how complex using the 7\\ display actually is I just used it as an example because I had just looked it up...

0	 A quick question about microcontroller digital level on I/O pins. I have a photo interrupter which is powered at 3.3V which is interfaced to Arduino UNO running at 5V. For microcontroller to detect high or low level is determined by signal higher than 5V*2/3 = 3.33V is high and signal lower than 5V*1/3 is low. What I dont understand is that arduino is able to detect the level change from the photo interrupter. Doesnt the supply on pins have to be greater than 2/3 or Vcc in order for it to detect logic high? The circuit works and I am able to count pulses from the interrupter but I want to know why that works considering the photo interrupt only gets about 3.23V. Please clarify

It receives G-code from a host computer or read from SD card. Here the important thing is that if you send M114 command it would report information about axis positions. Here I extended this command to make it print some internal variable as well. The Problem In Marlin.ino file there is a line says: volatile int extrudemultiply=100; //100-&gt;1 200-&gt;2 However my Reprap keep extruding and worse ejecting back a huge amount of filament. So I added some debug output for M114 command to output this value. It turn out this value is not the default value 100 but something like 12374. I thought somewhere inside setup</cod

I hope you guys can guid me please. First i found i can use Serial.println function to send some data then on the pc side it just checks and reads the port /dev/tty... But how does this process actually work under the hood? So if you use serial.println it knows about where to write? Second i also found its something to do with UART communication.. But inside Hardware.cpp file i couldnt find any function call to the one for UART. Third there is the code like extern HardwareSerial Serial; Then where is the definition of this Serial? Fourth There seem to have ring buffer for serial buffer. So when data is being sent then what and who fill the data into this buffer inside Hardware.cpp? please forgive my silly question.. im just so curious about this..

0	 I have an object whose constructor gets passed a parameter. If I know the parameter value at compile time I can construct the object statically: static FOOOBJ foo3; I understand that it isnt really done statically i.e. by the compiler but is actually done during setup. But if I dont know the parameter value at compile time Id still like to pre-allocate space for the object but construct the object in that space at run time. Can it be done without a separate .initialize method?

0	 I plan to use the SEN-00241 IR Emitter and Detector pair to detect a ping pong ball moving fast between them. I understand I could watch for voltage changes to detect this passing object however how do people generally deal with ambient light changes? From my research it seems that the voltage will change with ambient light and although I can take steps to create funnel vision between the 2 I\m sure it may still be an issue. Would you take constant readings and find averages over 10 consecutive readings to allow for changes in ambient light and set a new baseline reading? Then if the voltage changes dramatically and only for a few reads then I know that was the ball and not to change the baseline reading.

0	 So I built my First LED Cube and the thing turns ON!!! Pretty happy about that but here is my problem. When I try and get the Cube to display say a basic outline a wire form of a cube only the outer most LEDs are on The shift registers that I have daisy chained together give the correct display 80% of the time but the other 20% give completely wrong LEDs lighting up. I have used 4 74HC595 shift registers linked together so I am only using 3 of my Arduino ports to control the 5*5*5 Cube.The basic shape is there but the ones that are not meant to be lighting up cause a lot of flickering or ghosting ? in the center of the cube. I have thought about using pull up or pull down resistors but I find that when I run my program at a slower rate the LEDs that are lighting wrongly are lighting up controlled so I think it has to be something with my code or setup. Has anyone got any experience with LED cubes doing this? Also I am only using
0	 I have an issue with debouncing.I am using a MCP23017 as an I/O-extender with an Arduino. This uses I2C to communicate with each other. A variable amount of switches is connected to the MCP23017 0-16 switches. On change of the inputs an interrupt is generated and the Arduino captures this on rising edge. So whenever a button is pushed or released an interrupt is generated. Now Im confused as how I should debug them. One option would be to set a delay after an interrupt of lets say 50 ms before turning the interrupts back on. This could have an issue however since multiple inputs are connected to the same interrupt line. Another option is to have a timestamp or something for the last time each switch was changed and check if the time difference is big enough otherwise ignore the next pulse. The problem with this is that it uses quit some resources as I have limited memory and there can be up to 8 extenders so 8 * 16 = 128 inputs. What is the most

I know I can power the motor separately but this introduces the problem of needing a battery to power the motor 9V battery and another power source to power the Arduino another 9V battery? Would it be safe to simply power the Arduino with a 9V battery and use the Vin pin on the board which is unregulated and outputs directly the power source powering the Arduino to drive the motor? That way I power everything from the 9V battery and use a transistor to drive the motor. Thanks a lot! Steve.

0	 I have configured my arduino as a flash programmer and im sending data to an atmega328P. It is actually working and the data is send to my atmega328. But what is strange that the _delay_ms from from the Arduino library is not delaying in accurate seconds. _delay_ms1000 who should wait from 1s is actually more 8 seconds from my atmega328P hardware point of view. My question is what could possibly turn the program wrong. Im strongly assuming that this a misconfigured clock cycle from my Atmega but this is my newbie guess it can be something else thats why Im posting my question here. Can someone can hint me whats wrong with my configuration? Heres the sample code a dumb toggle pin on / off: #include &lt;util/delay.h&gt; // from arduino library/**/ DDRB |= 0b0000001; while 1 { PORTB = 0b00000001; _delay_ms1000; // it should be 1 second but on my hardware it is more ~8 seconds PORTB = 0b00000000; _delay_ms1000; } </
0	 My goal is to deliver very small quantities 100 microliters of fluid to the approximate center of a 25mm x 75mm surface. My first idea was to repurpose an old inkjet printer for the project. I thought Id load the fluid dispensers probably 3ml syringes into the unit where the ink cartridges would go and use an arduino to manipulate the linear encoder used by the printer to tell the dispenser unit where to go. Main problem at the moment is that Im having trouble getting the dispenser unit to go exactly where I want it to. Ive tried incorporating the PID library into my code to get the head to oscillate around the desired position until it stops at the right location. However the oscillation never stops and the head always moves beyond the desired position. Im trying to figure out the easiest way to get this done. Maybe thatll mean moving away from using the inkjet printer but Id like to get some feedback here before I make any decisions. Code:

0	 How can we make the Arduino board interact with old analog telephone and to make phone calls? I guess it involves connecting the board to the telephone with some specific cable how its called? In addition I assume it will require us to use the telephone low-level dialing protocol in order to actually interact with the phone and to send commands. Where can I read about it? Is there a reason to concern about conversation between the digital/serial board and an analogous device? By the way Ive read that analog telephones have relatively high voltages that can easily damage the board. Id love to get any information about things like this related to connecting Arduino to analog telephones in order to know about such issues and about what to be concerned and to explore. Thanks a lot!

0	 This is the first time Im using my Arduino. Its an Arduino UNO R3. I have two boards. One works but the other doesnt. I changed the ATmega328P from the broken one to the good one and it works so I can confirm that the controller works. The issue seems to be in the board. When I plug the board it doesnt come up either in Mac or in Windows. The LED blinks and the output pins have voltage but it seems that its only getting electricity from the computer its like the data channels dont respond. The other board works perfectly both on Windows and Mac. I checked the logs on the Mac and nothing changes when I plug the board. Its like Im not plugging anything. Is there a way to reset the board only? Maybe a component was badly soldered in the factory. I cant use the warranty because I got the board last year and never used it until now.

0	 It\s clearly documented that when global data is shared with an ISR and the main program the data needs to be declared volatile in order to guarantee memory visibility and that only suffices for 1-byte data; anything bigger needs special arrangements to guarantee also atomicity. Here we have good rules: Variables only used outside an ISR should not be volatile. Variables only used inside an ISR should not be volatile. Variables used both inside and outside an ISR should be volatile. But is volatile needed when the variable is accessed from > 1 ISRs but not shared outside ISRs? For example I have a function that maintains internal state using a static variable: void func { static volatile long counter; // volatile or not? // Do stuff wit

Im wondering what happens if I connect my digital pin to an analog input on Arduino and make digitalWrite and analogRead on the according pins. Here are the options I can think about: Just connect them directly - it is not a short circuit is it? Connect a resistor in between - the voltage should still be 5v right? Whatever resistor I use? Make a circuit: digital output -> resistor -> ground and connect the analog input in parallel in between the resistor and ground - Does it make sense? What is the difference with the previous option? As you see Im really confused now. I would highly appreciate if someone could explain in detail what is happening in all the cases with corresponding values for the current voltage and resistance .

0	 I\ve been working on a DIY keyboard project I have all the hardware designed and now its time for the code. For the microcontroller I\m sort of locked into an Arduino UNO r3 as I already have it lying around. I know it doesn\t have HID capabilities baked in but I can flash different firmware to it. At first I was going to go with a generic HID firmware. This approach was problematic because it would require me to first write/send my Arduino sketch then touch I wire to various portions of my UNO it isn\t SMD. After thisI would flash the HID firmware and hope that there were no bugs in my sketch as fixing bugs would have required flashing Arduino firmware and repeating the aforementioned steps. I then had the idea to use Teensy firmware https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/ . This approach seems better but I have questions regarding its feasibility. Can I upload Teensy programs/sketches to the Arduino after I\veup

0	 I just installed the Arduino IDE in openSUSE 13.1. I am able to open the application using the run dialogue so I know it has installed. However there is no way to open the IDE from any application launcher. I have tried both the Kickoff and Lancelot applciation managers. I have also tried to uninstall and re-install the IDE both through the 1-click on the Arduino website as well as through the command line. Does anyone know why I am unable to launch the application from the launcher? Thanks in advanced for any help! 
0	 I\ve got two arduino nano devices connected via RF 433 MHz. The modules are MX-05V and MX-FS-03V. I\m using VirtualWire for sending and receiving. The speed is set to 1000 bps. One has got a pir sensor and sends 1:ON when it detects movement and 1:OFF when movement stops. The other is just receiving these messages but after a while 20 messages the text is chopped off. I only receive 1. If I restart everything the same thing happens. They are currently on my table cca 20cm distance and powered by my PC via USB. What can I do? Is it because the modules are from ebay and probably not the best quality? Receive part: // recieveint ledPin = 13;int rcvPin = 13;#include &lt;VirtualWire.h&gt;byte message[VW_MAX_MESSAGE_LEN]; // a buffer to store the incoming messagesbyte messageLength = VW_MAX_MESSAGE_LEN; // the size of the messagevoid setup { Serial.begin9600; Serial.printlnDevice is ready; // Initialize the IO and ISR v

0	 Edit - Sorry its a Micro not a nano I have a Micro board hooked up to an easy driver breakout using its 5v output to power the Nano. Today I plugged it in and instead of booting up like normal the power leds on the wall plug the easy driver and the arduino started flashing and the Micro because very hot but not enough to burn. After that if I plug the Nano into the usb port it just rapidly blinks the pin 13 led. The PC does not detect the device but it does receive power. Holding or pushing the reset button doesnt seem to help at all. Ive used different usb cables and different ports on the PC as well to no effect. Is this something I can recover it from? Why did all the leds blink like that?

0	 I used Mifare Classic cards on a previous project and it worked brilliantly with the RIFD/NFC shield and Arduino Uno. I came across a Gen 2 EPC Class 1 RFID tags. This tags are long range ones. They use an IC chip called Alien Higgs3. I know that the shield itself is not capable of reading from a long range. I would just like to know if the shield is just able to read this type of tag even in close contact. Is there a UHF RFID Reader that I can use to connect it with the Arduino and read these tags? Any advice or suggestions are welcome. Thank alot. RFID Tag Specifications: Protocol- EPC Class 1 Gen2Frequency- 860-960 MHzIC Type chip- Alien Higgs3

0	 I was wondering if it was possible to use the utp port of a computer/laptop to transmit and receive data to an external device? If you take a cat5 cable there are 8 wires so lets say you have an Arduino would it be possible to use those wires for serial communication? If so how can I program the utp port? And is there a specification for this for example use wire x for output and wire y for input.. Thanks in advanceRegards Ps: I had no idea on which sub.stackexchange to ask it hopefully it suits here.

0	 I have in mind a small project but before purchasing the components I would like to know if it is feasible. What I understand is that the NFC TAG uses the 13.56MHz frequency so the Arduino needs a reader for that frequency. On eBay there are several vendors that sell the module MF-RC522 includes two NFC TAG so there are no problems. I\ll have to write a personal code which I\ll create on TAG and to do that I could take advantage of some APP for Android I have a Galaxy S3 and has the NFC; so the problem of writing should not be there. The real problem is reading this code by Arduino. All the examples found on the net demonstrate how to read the unique ID on this card but not how to read a personal value within the TAG. Can I do it through the module? Or is only possible read the unique ID?

0	 A friend of mine has a Zebra label printer. When connected to one of her laptops it prints out normally but when connected to another which she wants to use it inserts blank labels between printed ones. Everything is set up the same way on the two and she has already tried everything to fix it - in particular varying the settings. I suggested intercepting the messages sent from the two laptops and seeing which bits have had their values switched. Could Arduino be used to record the data being sent so we can analyze it similar to how you can intercept internet data and read unencrypted traffic? If so how would I go about doing this?

0	 The Arduino Digital Read Serial tutorial guides you through the wiring of a simple button. My questions are centered around the resistor. Why is the resistor necessary? I think I understand this but correct me if I am wrong. To ensure that the input pin reads a low signal and does not float we should connect the pin to ground when the button is not pushed. When the button gets pushed we will have a 5V signal flowing to both the pin and to ground. Kirchhoff\s voltage law states that total voltage in closed loop must equal zero so we have to deal with this 5V that is flowing directly to ground. That is why we put a resistor between the button and ground. How was the resistor value chosen? This is what I am unclear on. Ohm\s law states that... resistance = voltage / current This is a 5V supply and the Arduino Uno
